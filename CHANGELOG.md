## 🏷️ [0.6.0-beta-a] - 2026-09-18

> [!NOTE]
> **Beta.** Published as a semver prerelease (`0.6.0-beta-a`) under the npm `beta` dist-tag, so `npm install` keeps serving the newest stable release. `0.6.0a` is not valid semver — npm, the `bump-version` workflow and the version-consistency gate all reject it — so the release spells the beta out.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🚪 Single-Tool Gateway, Capability Catalog & Full Source Reorganization
> Everything on this branch since the `0.5.30` tag: the permanent cutover to a single public `unreal` gateway tool, a hand-authored capability catalog that now generates both the TypeScript and the C++ contract surfaces, cinematics/render/replay automation, and a top-to-bottom split of the TypeScript handlers and the C++ plugin into per-domain modules.
> **This release contains breaking changes** — see the **⚠️ Migration** section below.

<details>
<summary><b>✨ Added</b></summary>

- **Folded capability families** — a record can stand for a whole family of bridge actions. `routing.dispatchBy` maps one selector parameter's value to the existing handler action, and every former name stays callable as a folded legacy pair whose pins supply the value it implied; both gateways apply the same two steps (pins before validation, action after it). The folds are data (`records/folds/<parent>.folds.ts`, applied by `records/shared/fold.ts`): 244 fold families across 22 parents (222 of the resulting records dispatch through a `routing.dispatchBy` selector — 221 of them from the fold specs, plus `manage_level_structure.create_volume`, whose `volumeClass` dispatch is authored on the record itself — and the remaining 23 families are pure-alias folds; 246 of the 380 records carry at least one folded legacy pair, across 1,166 pinned pairs) take the catalog from 1,379 authored pre-fold action entries to **380 records**, while all 1,549 `{tool, action}` pairs (every shipped name plus 164 new family primaries) still resolve, describe and execute, the normalization audit total is unchanged at 1,341, and a fold whose primary is one of its members keeps the selector optional so every pre-fold call is unchanged. A consent grant may name the capability by any name it answers to (canonical id, alias, or a folded `tool.action` pair) on both doors; the native completion pool completes the old names too; the search index counts a name once per identifier field and stops re-scoring folded member ids as aliases. Per-action contract tests pin the authored, unfolded records (`records/unfolded.ts`), and the integration suites derive one twin case per family (`tests/fold-twins.mjs`) so every advertised primary and selector is exercised.

#### Gateway surface

- **`unreal` gateway tool with four operations** — `search`, `describe`, `execute`, and `configure` are now the entire public MCP surface on both transports. The routing engine lives in `src/server/gateway/` (26 TypeScript modules) and covers capability indexing and views, search filters, browse/capability describe modes, execute resolve → validate → policy → authorization → dispatch, receipt context, schema normalization, guidance, and availability probing.
- **Execute idempotency ledger** — repeat `execute` calls carrying the same idempotency key return the original receipt instead of re-running the action. Mirrored on both sides of the bridge: TypeScript (`src/server/gateway/idempotency-ledger.ts`, cap 1024) and C++ (`Private/Foundation/McpIdempotencyLedger`, cap 4096).
- **Compensation receipts and capability principals** — `Private/Foundation/McpCompensationReceipt` and `McpCapabilityPrincipal`/`McpCapabilityAuthorization` give the plugin its own authorization identity rather than trusting the caller's claim.
- **`DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` migration receipt** — a direct `tools/call` on a canonical parent name returns a bounded, executable receipt whose `nextCall` re-runs the same request through the gateway.
- **Execute option validation and refusal** — `timeoutMs` must be an integer in 1..600000 ms and `idempotencyKey` 1..128 characters — a malformed key previously bypassed the ledger entirely, so a retry re-ran the mutation with nothing reporting that dedup was off. `preview` is refused outright with `UNSUPPORTED_PREVIEW` (no dispatch path implements a dry run, and `behavior.supportsPreview` is deliberately not consulted, because honouring it would perform the real mutation and call it a preview), and an option that is accepted but not implemented (`savePolicy`, `validationLevel`, `taskPreference`) answers `UNSUPPORTED_OPTION` instead of being validated, echoed on a success receipt, and dropped. An `expectedCatalogRevision` that no longer matches answers `STALE_STATE`. A result that would exceed the transport budget is refused as `RESULT_TOO_LARGE` (100,000 characters, 6,000,000 for image-payload capabilities) on the failure path as well as the success path.
- **Bounded search** — `limit` defaults to 12 and is capped at 25, a page is additionally held to `maxBytes` (default 24,576, floor 512, ceiling 262,144) by dropping whole trailing rows, and `hasMore`, `truncated`, `truncationReason`, `nextCursor`, `coercions` and `budgetExceeded` report exactly what happened: an argument that was clamped is named, a page that could not fit even one row answers `budgetExceeded` instead of returning an identical cursor forever, and a truncated page says why. A capability id or alias that collides in the index fails closed with `GATEWAY_INDEX_CONFLICT` rather than resolving to an arbitrary record.

#### Capability catalog and contract generation

- **Hand-authored capability records as the single source of truth** — `src/tools/catalog/capabilities/records/**` holds **380 records** across the **23** canonical parents, authored with `buildCoreRecord()` declaring deltas only. `aggregate.ts` hard-asserts the record count and throws on mismatch.
- **Generation pipeline** — `scripts/generate-canonical-registry.ts` (+ the `scripts/canonical-registry/` modules) emits the generated capability shards, the orchestration routing index, the docs action reference, and the C++ side: `Private/MCP/Generated/` shards and `McpGeneratedParentRegistry*`. `scripts/generate-gateway-manifest.ts` (+ `scripts/gateway-manifest/`) emits `src/gateway/gateway-manifest.generated.{ts,json}` with content hashing and path policy.
- **New drift gates** — `registry:generate`, `registry:check`, `manifest:check`, `policy:generate`, `policy:check`, `normalization:check`, `normalization:audit`, `migration:check`, `primitives:check`, `security:check`, `eval:check`, `version:check`, `workflow:check`.
- **Deterministic ordering helper** — `src/utils/serialization/ordering.ts` provides byte-order comparison so generated shards are byte-identical across machines and locales (`localeCompare` is no longer used for ordering).

#### MCP protocol primitives

- **Resources, prompts, completions and progress** — new `src/server/mcp-primitives/` implements the primitive registry, wiring, handlers, notifications, catalog revision reader, and fallback pointers, with a prompt catalog and typed prompt errors, a completion provider (ranking, slots, sources, fixtures), and a progress reporter/token/sink registry.
- **MCP Tasks (`2025-11-25`)** — a per-session **bounded** task store implementing the MCP SDK's own `TaskStore` contract, so `tasks/get|list|cancel|result` are auto-registered and reachable from the wire. It deliberately does not reuse the SDK's `InMemoryTaskStore`, which is unbounded, drives expiry off real `setTimeout` timers, and ignores `sessionId` entirely. Task checkpoints ride alongside it.
- **Resource subscriptions and revisions** — a subscription store with a notification coalescer so bursts of editor changes collapse into one client notification, plus resource revision stamps for change detection.
- **Session capability profiles and `configure` state** — a client profile store, a session capability profile and a session configure store model the gateway's `configure` operation and per-client capability negotiation. The session resolver is exercised by tests only — nothing in the stdio path installs one yet.
- **Elicitation decision policy** — a decision policy (`isSafeToElicit`) that answers whether a field is safe to elicit. Elicitation itself is wired into the execute path: `dispatchAndValidate()` awaits `maybeElicitMissingArgs()`, which prefills only missing required primitive fields through the client's elicitation function, under a timeout and a `missing-params` fallback. It never elicits secrets, tokens, or credentials, and never a destructive-confirmation value. Mirrored natively for cross-transport parity.
- **Resource providers** — new `src/resources/` supplies capability resources, editor-state resources, knowledge resources, the resource catalog, read router, typed resource errors, and asset pagination.
- **Native primitive parity** — the plugin gained matching `Private/MCP/Primitives/`, `Resources/`, `Routing/`, `Execute/`, `Gateway/`, and `DynamicTools/` modules (task store and methods, subscription store, notification coalescer, completion pools and provider, prompt catalog/render/argument validation, client profile store, elicitation policy), audited by the `primitives:check` parity harness.
- **Protocol negotiation** — support for `2025-11-25` plus the native transport's `MCP-Protocol-Version` header guard: a present-but-unsupported version is refused with HTTP 400, while an absent header derives from the session's negotiated version and otherwise falls back to the `2025-03-26` default. Native accepts the three modern versions; the TypeScript SDK additionally accepts two legacy ones, from the pinned SDK's own supported set rather than from code in this repository.
- **Bounded task store and progress** — only `search` and `describe` may be task-augmented; any mutating operation, and any tool other than `unreal`, is refused with `TASK_CHECKPOINT_REFUSED` before any work runs. The per-session store is capped at 32 tasks with a 5 to 30 minute lifetime, refuses creation with a JSON-RPC `-32600` `TASK_STORE_AT_CAPACITY` while every retained task is still running, and permits exactly one terminal transition (`TASK_ALREADY_TERMINAL`). Progress notifications carry the client's own `_meta` token (without one the reporter is inert rather than inventing an id), are strictly monotonic, and are bounded to 64 notifications per operation with a 512-character message clamp and a 256-entry reporter map.
- **Resource surface** — `resources/templates/list` is registered with four templates (`ue://capability/{capabilityId}`, `ue://knowledge/{engineVersion}/{topic}`, `ue://object/{objectPath}`, `ue://asset/{assetPath}`) plus five static resources (`ue://capability/catalog`, `ue://project`, `ue://editor`, `ue://selection`, `ue://state/revisions`), every read is held to a 64 KiB budget with typed `RESOURCE_*` codes (`RESOURCE_TRAVERSAL_REJECTED` for host paths and traversal), and `ue://health` now also carries `readiness`, the telemetry `diagnostics` snapshot, `currentSession`/`previousSession` and `metricsExposition` alongside the capability and editor-state resources.

#### Cinematics, render and media automation

- Complete native and WebSocket **cinematics, Movie Render Queue, media, Take Recorder, and replay** automation coverage, with live-editor verification harnesses.

#### Blueprint authoring

- **`add_event` supports component-bound events** — pass `componentName` plus `eventName` (the delegate name) to wire a component's multicast delegate (e.g. `NearMissZone.OnComponentBeginOverlap`). Previously such requests fell through to the custom-event branch and produced an unbound `Event_<guid>` that never fired. The new branch resolves the SCS component, locates the multicast delegate property on its class (accepting both the bare name and the `__DelegateSignature` suffix), and creates a properly initialized `UK2Node_ComponentBoundEvent` with `ComponentPropertyName`, `DelegatePropertyName`, and `DelegateOwnerClass` set. Idempotent on repeat calls; returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` / `COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND` / `COMPONENT_CLASS_UNRESOLVED` / `DELEGATE_NOT_FOUND` when inputs are missing or unresolvable. Guarded by `MCP_HAS_K2NODE_COMPONENTBOUNDEVENT` so the file still compiles on engine layouts where the header isn't reachable.
- **`create_node` / `add_node` sets the widget class on CreateWidget nodes** — a `K2Node_CreateWidget` previously fell through to generic instantiation that never assigned `WidgetType`, producing a generic `UUserWidget` `Class` pin and an untyped `Return Value`. A dedicated branch now reads `targetClass` (Widget Blueprint asset path such as `/Game/Widgets/WBP_HUD`, or a class name), resolves it, and assigns `WidgetType` before pin allocation so `ReconstructNode` builds the correct typed `Return Value`. Returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` / `CLASS_NOT_FOUND`.
- **`create_node` / `add_node` sets the target class on DynamicCast nodes** — a `K2Node_DynamicCast` ("Cast To …") previously produced an unusable "Bad cast node" with only a wildcard `Object` pin and no typed `As <Class>` output. A dedicated cast branch reads `targetClass`, resolves it via `ResolveClassByName`, and assigns `UK2Node_DynamicCast::TargetType`.
- Factored the class-resolution and payload-reading logic shared by DynamicCast and CreateWidget into `ResolveTargetClassFromString` and `ReadTargetClassPayload`, so every node branch with a class pin accepts the same input forms (Blueprint asset path, generated-class path, native class name) and the same legacy field fallbacks (`memberClass` / `nodeClass` / `widgetType`, plus a `CastTo<Class>` prefix peel from `nodeType`).
- **`add_variable` applies `defaultValue`** — the handler read the field but never assigned it, so every variable was created with a zero/empty default (a float requested as `0.35` stayed `0`). The parsed default is now written to `FBPVariableDescription::DefaultValue` with type-aware formatting: booleans as lowercase `true`/`false`, integer/byte categories as whole numbers, floats/doubles via `SanitizeFloat`, and strings/struct literals passed through.
- **18 widget-authoring actions are now routable on both surfaces** — `add_quest_tracker`, `add_safe_zone`, `add_spacer`, `add_widget_component`, `add_widget_switcher`, `bind_localized_text`, `create_credits_screen`, `create_shop_ui`, `create_widget_style`, `delete_animation`, `get_widget_slot_info`, `remove_widget`, `rename_widget`, `reparent_widget`, `set_font`, `set_localization_key`, `set_margin`, and `set_widget_binding` were absent from both the TypeScript `WIDGET_AUTHORING_ACTIONS` set and the native `WidgetAuthoring()` routing array, so the handlers behind them could not be reached. Added to both, with matching capability-record property fragments for the widget path, layout, content, and panel inputs.
- **Promoted skeleton routes are named on both surfaces** — fifteen previously hidden native skeleton routes (`add_socket`, `modify_socket`, `set_physics_asset`, `modify_physics_body`, `remove_physics_body`, `set_physics_constraint`, `get_physics_asset_info`, `list_morph_targets`, `set_morph_target_value`, `get_bone_transform`, `list_virtual_bones`, `remove_socket`, plus the `delete_*` spellings) now carry explicit route names on the TypeScript `SKELETON_ACTIONS` and the native `Skeleton()` routing array, with twelve promoted to canonical capability records (marked `post-migration` so the pre-gateway audit total stays truthful). The remaining three `delete_*` spellings (`delete_socket`, `delete_morph_target`, `delete_virtual_bone`) stay hidden pending a retrieval-IDF budget fix.

#### Plugin capabilities

- **`MCP_NATIVE_PORT` environment variable** — overrides the native MCP HTTP/SSE port at startup without editing committed ini, so several editors can run at once on distinct ports. Falls back to the `Native MCP Port` project setting when unset or invalid.
- **`IKRigEditor` optional module** — declared for the `create_ik_rig` path so IK Rig creation works without a hard dependency on the editor module being present.
- **Pre-queue capability gate** — every automation request is authorized before it reaches the editor queue (`Private/Core/Security/McpPrequeueGate`), resolving the demand with the same `NormalizeAction` the dispatchers use, so a payload cannot authorize one capability and execute another. The refusal order is fixed (scope, consent, project, paths, path coverage, console command, consent nonce, quota), a refused request performs no editor work at all (the in-handler checks remain as post-queue defence), an unknown or misspelled action fails closed to `Admin`, an ambiguous one takes the strictest scope, and the recursive console-command scan (depth 8, 4096 nodes) treats a truncated scan as `COMMAND_BLOCKED`.
- **Scoped capability tokens, quotas and single-use consent** — a scoped token carries its profile, scopes, allowed path prefixes, allowed projects and per-minute request/tool-call quotas (a scoped `Admin` entry is invalid and ignored), and the `bridge_ack` `authority` block reports the effective identity without ever carrying the token, its paths or its limits. A presented-but-unresolvable token is refused even where a token is not required, and a project-restricted principal is refused at the handshake rather than per request. The quota ledger is shared by both transports, keyed by principal rather than socket or session, bounded to 256 tracked identities with least-recently-seen eviction, charged only after every other refusal, and `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` is the one refusal marked retryable — so a reconnect cannot reset a budget. A consent grant's nonce is burned after all authorization refusals and before the quota charge, so a replay answers `CONSENT_REUSED` without spending budget; nonce-less grants from older clients keep capability-match-only behaviour.
- **New state and refusal codes** — `STALE_STATE` and the `UNDO_UNAVAILABLE_*` family (`_DURABLE_WRITE`, `_EXTERNAL_PROCESS`, `_ASYNC_PIPELINE`, `_NO_TRANSACTION_BUFFER`, `_NON_TRANSACTIONAL_OBJECT`, plus `UNDO_BROKEN_BY_DURABLE_WRITE` from a package-saved witness) join the shared strings, `EDITOR_BLOCKED` reports a game-thread stall over 15 s, and `EDITOR_STATE_MISMATCH` reports a preview/state mismatch.
- **Cancellation and deferred replies are attributed to their transport** — a cancel from a socket that does not own the request is refused, and `McpRequestOriginRegistry` (cap 512) records the admitting transport per request id. That fixes native `/mcp` deferred replies which used to fall back to the WebSocket path, get dropped, and surface to the caller as an untyped 300 s `TIMEOUT`.
- **Editor policy surfaces** — the plugin settings carry the Movie Render Queue caps (dimension 8192, 33,554,432 px aggregate, `MaxMovieRenderAggregateWork`, executor/burn-in/Take-Recorder class allowlists) and the native session limits (600 requests and 120 tool calls per minute per client).
- **Bounded native sessions** — at most 16 active sessions (`MaxActiveSessions`) with a 120 s idle reclaim, and a 32-connection ceiling (`MaxConcurrentConnections`) that answers 503 beyond it.

#### Replies that report what actually happened

A write that lands is not a write that is correct, and several actions used to answer a bare `success` for a result the caller would only discover by looking at the editor. These replies now carry the finding itself:

- **Placement feedback on `control_actor` spawn and `set_transform`** — the reply names what the actor interpenetrates (`overlappingActors[]` with `penetrationDepth`), whether it is sunk into or floating above the surface beneath it (`groundZ`, `groundClearance`), and a `suggestedLocation` that rests on that surface. A Character's location is its capsule **centre**, so reusing a mesh's feet-relative Z buries it to the waist — the exact bug this was written for. Volume/trigger/light actors and subsystem debug-draw proxies (whose bounds span the level) are excluded, and slabs bedded into each other are read as floor layering rather than penetration, so the findings are the real ones.
- **`control_actor.audit_placement`** — the same check swept over a whole level for placements nobody will call back into. Findings come worst-first with a severity in world units, a `byKind` tally (`sunk`/`floating`/`overlapping`/`unsupported`) and `minSeverity`/`nameFilter`/`limit` to narrow, so one sweep of a 776-actor level answers within the transport budget instead of being refused as `RESULT_TOO_LARGE`. A geometric test cannot tell a mistake from a composition — a keep beds its towers into its platform, an island is meant to hang in the air — so an actor tagged `mcp.placement.ok` drops out as both subject and overlap target, letting the flagged count reach zero and mean something instead of training the caller to ignore it.
- **`audit_placement` also catches an actor lying on its side** — overlap and ground checks both pass for a building tipped onto its face: it is inside nothing, and its now-horizontal bounds still rest on the floor. Eighteen shop houses in one level stood on their gable ends with the sweep reporting nothing, because the ±90 meant to turn them to face the street had been written into `pitch` instead of `yaw`. Lean is now measured as the angle between the actor's up vector and world up, so yaw never counts and a fully inverted actor reads 180 rather than wrapping back to 0. Severity stays in world units — the distance the actor's top travelled from upright — so a toppled house outranks a tipped pebble instead of tying with it at "90", and `maxTilt` (default 30°) keeps the few degrees of lean that make a prop look hand-placed from reporting. Only actors that render a mesh are judged: rotation is the whole point of a light, a camera or a decal.
- **Re-using a `slotName` edits that widget instead of duplicating it** — re-adding is how a caller changes an existing widget ("the text block called `Txt_Health` now reads 0"), and `ConstructWidget` re-initialises the object already holding that name rather than making a second one. That re-initialisation clears the widget's `Slot`, so `GetParent()` answered null while the parent panel's slot list still pointed at the widget, and the add appended a second slot for the same widget — one widget listed twice under one parent, with the graph's variable binding to whichever the compiler reached first. Three HUDs were corrupted this way before the cause was found. The detach now asks the panels which of them lists the widget, because a parent's slot list survives the re-initialisation that erases the widget's own back-pointer, and it carries the slot's layout and Z-order across the re-seat — otherwise editing a label's text silently moved it to the panel's default corner. Geometry passed in the call still wins.
- **A whole-graph pin read reports pin literals, like the single-node one does** — `inspect_graph` with `info: "graph"` and `includePins` emitted each pin’s type, direction and `linkedTo` but never its `defaultValue`, while `info: "pins"` on the same pin did. Nothing said the field was being withheld, so an absent `defaultValue` read as “this pin is empty”: a branch comparing the level name against `"L_Hub"` looked like it compared against `""`, and a `bShowMouseCursor` that was set looked unset. Both readings were wrong and both sent a live debugging session down the wrong path. The graph-level view now emits `defaultValue`/`defaultTextValue`/`defaultObjectPath` on the same terms as the per-node view.
- **`create_node` seeds a Get Subsystem node with its subsystem type** — the `UK2Node_GetSubsystem` family (`GetSubsystem`, `GetSubsystemFromPC`, `GetEngineSubsystem`, `GetEditorSubsystem`) keeps its type in a `CustomClass` UPROPERTY that the editor palette seeds via `Initialize()` before the node is placed, not on a pin. Spawned by class name the property stayed null, so the node came back with an untyped result pin and the blueprint stopped compiling with "Node Invalid Subsystem Type must have a class specified" — and nothing could repair it, because the visible `Class` pin is only promoted into `CustomClass` during node reconstruction and `set_node_property` cannot reach the property. `targetClass` was accepted and silently ignored, so the only evidence was a compile error on a later call. The node is now seeded from `targetClass` before its pins are allocated, a non-`USubsystem` class is rejected, and a request without `targetClass` is refused rather than answered with a node that can never compile. Found wiring `AddMappingContext` into a live player controller.
- **`set_node_property` names the properties it accepts** — an unsupported name answered `Unsupported node property 'X'` and nothing else, so a caller could not tell a misspelling from a property that is simply not settable there, and had to guess. The refusal now lists the supported set and says that a node is moved with `NodePosX`/`NodePosY` and that node-class fields such as a cast target are set at creation via `create_node` `targetClass`.
- **`delete_node` refuses a `pinName` it would have ignored** — `break_pin_links` folds into `delete_node` under `deleteScope: "pin_links"`, so sending `pinName` without that scope meant "operate on this pin" and "delete the whole node" at once, and the node won, silently. It cost a live Branch node and the whole death branch hanging off it before the cause was clear. A destructive default must not resolve a contradiction in its own favour: the call is now refused with `CONTRADICTORY_SCOPE`, naming the scope that does what the pin was obviously meant to do. The refusal runs above the transaction, so a rejected request leaves no empty undo entry.
- **`manage_asset` `edit_struct` reports `saved`** — and warns via `persistenceWarning` when `save` was omitted, because struct members added in memory survive the session, pass `list_struct_members`, expose Break-struct pins, accept DataTable imports, and then vanish on the next editor start. `save_all` never rescues them: the package is not dirty.
- **`import_rows` reports `fieldsDefaulted`** — with a `dataLossWarning` naming the columns the entry omitted, because the import builds each row from a default-constructed struct. A 5-field import over a 20-field row used to reset the other 15 and still answer `imported: n, invalidRows: []`.
- **A throttled save no longer reports a write that did not happen** — `SaveLoadedAssetThrottled` skipped saves inside its window and returned `true` regardless, so a caller editing one Blueprint in a burst was told `saved: true` for every edit while only the first reached disk, and lost the tail of the burst on the next editor start. It now refuses to skip a package with unsaved work; a clean package is still skipped, because there is nothing to write.
- **`manage_blueprint compile` marks the recompiled asset unsaved** — a compile regenerates the class in memory without dirtying the package, so `control_editor.save_all` answered "0 dirty" and the caller concluded everything had persisted while the asset on disk still carried the previous bytecode. Compiling from the editor UI marks the asset unsaved; the action now does the same and reports `pendingSave` with a `persistenceHint`, so the ordinary edit → compile → save_all workflow ends with the work actually on disk.
- **`CONSENT_REQUIRED` hands back the grant that satisfies it** — the native refusal now spells out the exact `consent` sibling to re-send, matching what the TypeScript gateway already returned. It previously named only the gap and pointed at `describe`, so a caller's first use of any consent-bearing capability cost a full contract round-trip to learn two strings the refusal already held. The re-send still names the capability, which is what the gate is for.

#### Services and tests

- **Telemetry and readiness services** — `src/services/` gained a telemetry registry, observation and schema modules plus a readiness probe.
- **New test tiers** — `tests/eval/` (own Vitest config, run by `eval:check`), `tests/audits/`, `tests/harness/`, and `tests/fixtures/`, alongside `scripts/qa/` adversarial, cross-transport matrix, and capability-metadata audits.
- **Readiness vs. health** — `/health` now answers 503 while the server is not ready instead of reporting `ok` unconditionally, and a new `/ready` probe reports the same state without the health payload.
- **Capability-aware timeouts** — operation timeouts derive from the record's declared cost tier: `resolveActionTimeoutMs()` reads the generated `capability-cost-index.generated.ts` for the `tool::action` pair and maps its latency and resources onto `CAPABILITY_TIMEOUT_TIER_MS` (15 s to 20 min), with a 15 s floor, a 120 s fallback for unclassified pairs, and an `MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` override — replacing one flat default for every action.
- **Asset-listing cache invalidation** — the listing is invalidated after every successful mutation (`invalidateAssetCacheForMutation()` runs straight after dispatch, with 26 listing-neutral actions exempted and everything else treated as a mutation, fail-safe). The `/Content/...` alias is now mapped before path sanitization, which fixes a deleted asset lingering in the cache for the full TTL because sanitization threw on the unaliased path and the catch swallowed it. A diagnostics snapshot reader with a 64 KiB cap and an allowlist projection (tokens, paths and session ids dropped) joins the automation client, though nothing on the production path reads it yet.

#### Handlers, catalog and native routing

- **User-defined action aliases** — a project can add its own action names in `handler-aliases.json` (schema `Resources/MCP/custom-handler-aliases.schema.json`): version 1, at most 128 aliases and 64 KB, `lower_snake_case` names only, resolved through three search paths. An alias pointing at another alias, or at the protected `inspect`/`manage_tools` actions, is rejected, and an alias whose target is not registered yet stays pending until the target arrives.
- **Geometry dynamic-mesh authoring** — `manage_geometry` gained procedural-mesh authoring through one `edit_dynamic_mesh` family: `create_procedural_mesh`, `append_vertex`, `append_triangle`, `delete_vertex`, `delete_triangle`, `get_vertex_position`, `set_vertex_position`, `set_vertex_color`, `set_uvs`, `split_normals`, `translate_mesh` and a boolean `difference`.
- **AI authoring routes** — `set_ai_perception`, `create_nav_modifier` and `set_ai_movement` join behaviour tree, blackboard, EQS query, MassEntity, SmartObject, StateTree, navigation and nav-actor configuration as named actions instead of only through the behaviour-tree umbrella.
- **Native search matches words, and pages** — the native gateway search matcher scores word-level matches and accepts `actionOffset` and `maxBytes` so a large action list can be paged.

#### Fab asset-store bridge

- **`McpAutomationBridgeFab` delay-loaded module** — a second editor module that bridges the Fab asset store through the Fab plugin's own browser widget and download API (`McpFabBrowserBridge`, `McpFabSearchOperation`, `McpFabDetailsOperation`, `McpFabAddToProject`, `McpFabImportWatcher`). Its Fab and Megascans engine dependencies are declared optional and listed in `PublicDelayLoadDLLs` on Win64, so the module compiles away when they are absent. The store actions themselves are dispatched by the main module's `Private/Domains/AssetWorkflow/`: `search_fab_listings`, `get_fab_listing_details`, `add_fab_asset_to_project`, `download_fab_asset`, `list_fab_downloads`, `list_fab_library`, `list_megascans_library`, and `import_megascans_asset`. Two further actions, `list_content_sources` and `migrate_assets`, are generic content ingestion (engine templates, engine and plugin content, downloaded Bridge packs) rather than Fab-specific, and a migrate request never carries a filesystem path: it names a root token plus a relative id, both resolved against a fixed root table.
- **Diagnostics snapshot store** — `Foundation/Diagnostics/` ships a bounded, crash-tolerant singleton that records request admission, pre-dispatch, refusal, terminal, handshake, disconnect, and session events to `<Project>/Saved/MCP/diagnostics/`. Atomic file writes with temp+rename, previous-session rotation, corrupt-file tolerance with one-shot bounded warnings.
- **Reflected function invocation** — `Foundation/Reflection/McpReflectedInvoke` provides a shared RAII parameter-block marshalling primitive for arbitrary UFunction invoke, gated behind `effect: destructive` + `consent: elevated` on both `control_editor.invoke_reflected_function` and `control_actor.call_actor_function`.
- **`native-gates.ps1`** — PowerShell script for local native compile and smoke gates (`npm run native:compile`, `native:smoke`, `native:smoke:core`, `native:smoke:fab`, `native:check`), so a non-compiling C++ security control can never pass CI.

#### Source control and project setup

- **A project can be put under revision control from the tool** — `source_control_checkout` and `source_control_submit` shipped, but the step that has to happen first had no action at all, so on a project that had never been committed both answered `SOURCE_CONTROL_DISABLED` and the only way forward was the editor's Revision Control login dialog: the exact UI an automation caller is replacing. `source_control_init` creates the repository, writes an Unreal `.gitignore`, makes the first commit and selects the Git provider; `source_control_commit_all` snapshots everything after that. `source_control_enable` had been dispatched by the plugin since the source-control handlers were written, but no capability record ever published it, so the gateway rejected the action name outright — an implemented, registered, documented handler nothing could call. Both new actions run git on a worker thread and hop back to the game thread to answer, because `git add` over a full Content tree takes minutes and `ExecProcess` blocks its caller: on the game thread the editor stops pumping and the bridge socket looks dead. The `.gitignore` is not cosmetic — without it the stage walks roughly 10 GB of `Intermediate/`, `Saved/` and `Binaries/`. "Nothing to commit" reports `alreadyClean` rather than an error so a caller snapshotting on a timer sees no spurious failures, and every git invocation is returned in `steps[]` so a failure names the command that failed.

#### Widget styling and receipts

- **`set_style` can round a widget's corners** — every UMG panel this tool could author was a hard-edged rectangle and nothing on the published surface could change that, so a request to polish a UI had no answer short of hand-editing the asset. `cornerRadius` (plus optional `outlineColor` and `outlineWidth`) now applies to whichever brush the widget actually draws with: an Image's `Brush`, a Border's `Background`, or **all four** of a Button's normal/hovered/pressed/disabled brushes — rounding one alone makes the corners snap square under the cursor. A widget with no brush refuses with `STYLE_FIELD_UNSUPPORTED` and names the three classes that have one, instead of falling through to the generic reflection path that would answer success without changing anything.
- **Every receipt reports the world the request ran against** — an actor mutation reported success for whichever world was current at that instant, so if a level load then replaced that world the actor was unreachable and the receipt gave no hint anything had changed underneath it; the failure looked like the mutation never happened. Receipts now carry `worldName`.
- **Transport diagnostics name the dispatched capability** — `tools/call` logged only the parent tool, so an editor death left behind `tool=control_editor`, one of twenty possible actions, with no way to attribute the crash. The dispatched capability and at-cap session evictions are now logged.

<summary><b>🔧 Changed</b></summary>

- **Static `unreal` gateway tool replaces the 23-tool public surface.** The TypeScript stdio and native MCP transports now permanently expose a single `unreal` tool. The 23 canonical parents (`manage_asset`, `control_actor`, …) are internal and reachable only through `search`, `describe`, `execute`, and `configure`. This reduces client context pressure and eliminates hallucinated tool/action calls.
- **C++ plugin reorganized into per-domain modules** — `Private/` is now split into `Core/` (errors, requests, security, subsystem), `Domains/` (**66** domain directories), `Foundation/` (blueprint, bridge helpers, handler utils, capability authorization, idempotency, compensation), `MCP/` (transport, routing, execute, gateway, primitives, resources, dynamic tools, generated shards, tools), `Safety/`, and `Transport/`. The former per-tool `McpTool_*.cpp` files and the `McpNativeTransport.{h,cpp}` monolith are gone, replaced by generated registries and `Private/MCP/Transport/`.
- **`Private/Safety/` split into per-operation headers** — asset save, level save, map load, folder delete (assets/verify), animation delete, delete quiesce/compilation, world delete, package tools, material, and classification each have their own header; `McpSafeOperations.h` survives only as a short umbrella that includes them.
- **TypeScript tools reorganized** — the monolithic `src/tools/handlers/*-handlers.ts` files were replaced by **37** per-domain directories (**203** files, up from 64 flat ones at `v0.5.30`), and `src/tools/` now holds `catalog/` (capability records), `definitions/` (tool schemas), `orchestration/` (the canonical dispatcher, routing, and generated routing index), `dynamic/`, and `handlers/`. The former `src/tools/editor/` and `src/tools/level/` class modules had no live caller and are gone; the live code is `src/tools/handlers/editor/` and `src/tools/handlers/level/`. Types were split into `src/types/handlers/` and `src/types/tools/`; utilities were regrouped into nine `src/utils/` areas (`commands`, `paths`, `responses`, `validation`, `collections`, `serialization`, `logging`, `config`, `interaction`).
- **Automation bridge split into focused modules** — `src/automation/` now separates the client, config, frame codec, state, status, connection lifecycle, request dispatcher, request context/correlation, cancellation errors, capability-token provider, log redaction, the gateway consent/correlation/timeout/expected-revisions contexts, the read-only diagnostics snapshot reader, and the natural-timeout cancellation path.
- **`control_actor` spawn is transactional** — a requested `meshPath` that can't be applied no longer leaves a misconfigured actor in the level. It fails `MESH_NOT_FOUND` before spawning if the mesh can't load, or rolls back (`Destroy()` + `MESH_APPLY_FAILED`) if a resolved mesh can't be applied.
- **Console-command validation is generated** — the allow/deny model now lives in `src/utils/commands/console-command-policy*.ts` with a generated policy artifact and a `policy:check` drift gate, instead of a hand-maintained validator.
- **Minimum Node.js raised to `>=20.19.0`** (was `>=18`).
- **Structural scale of the reorganisation** — `src/` grew from 154 files to 832, the plugin's `Private/` tree from 133 `.cpp`/`.h` files in one flat list to 1,530 files under `Core/`, `Domains/`, `Foundation/`, `MCP/`, `Safety/`, `Tests/`, `Transport/` and `UI/`, and `src/tools/handlers/` from 64 flat files to 203 files in 37 domain directories.
- **`MCP_DEFAULT_CATEGORIES` is inert** — setting it now logs a warning and changes nothing: the public surface is the single gateway tool, so there is no category listing left to filter.
- **ESLint enforces the Node floor** — `eslint-plugin-n`'s node-builtins and ES-syntax rules run at `warn` (and therefore fail CI's `--max-warnings=0`), so an API above Node 20.19 cannot land unnoticed.
- **`manage_tools.list_tools` / `get_status` contract change** — the `description` field is dropped from the row shape, and `catalogRevision` plus `catalogStateRevision` are reported instead of hardcoded counts.

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ Security</b></summary>

- **Scopes are exact-set membership with an `Admin` wildcard, not rank-based** — `Write` does **not** imply `Read`, and an unresolvable capability demands `Admin`.
- **Consent rides as an `automation_request` envelope sibling, never a handler param**, and is re-validated plugin-side. It is never inferred from loopback, a prior call, idempotency, or preview.
- **Capability-token auth is on by default** — tokens compare in constant time and are never logged; the plugin re-enforces every check the TypeScript layer performs.
- **Path handling routed through a shared canonicalizer** — paths are limited to `/Game`, `/Engine`, `/Script`, `/Temp`, `/Niagara` plus sanitized additions, with the `/Content` alias handled in one place instead of re-implemented per handler.
- **Render/media output hardening** — continuous local output-path validation against symlink replacement, and network-backed media URLs disabled because redirect destinations cannot be pinned.
- **Native transport hardening** — client-scoped rate limits retained across native MCP session rotation, strict native `manage_tools` argument validation, and sanitized streamed log payloads.
- **An `action`/`subAction` mismatch can no longer authorize one capability and execute another.** `AuthorizeAutomationRequest` normalizes any payload that declares both with different values (overwriting `action` from the authoritative `subAction`), the native execute stage stamps `subAction` from the server-resolved action, and the pre-queue gate resolves its demand with the same `NormalizeAction` the dispatchers call, so the gate and the dispatcher cannot disagree.
- **Scoped tokens are narrower than the legacy token by construction** — a scoped token may list only `Read`/`Write`/`Destructive` (never `Admin`), and a scoped token colliding with the legacy token wins because the narrower grant applies.
- **Reflected property access cannot reach the plugin's own settings** — `McpSafeReflectionTarget` refuses every `/Script` target with `OBJECT_NOT_ADDRESSABLE`, deliberately distinct from `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`, from the array, element, insert and append property handlers, so a path- or project-restricted principal cannot reach the settings that govern the transport itself: a `write`-scoped principal could otherwise switch off `bRequireCapabilityToken` through `inspect.set_property`, and a `read`-scoped principal could read the Admin token out. `/Game`, `/Engine`, spawned actors and Blueprint CDOs are unaffected.
- **URL-looking arguments are refused outright** — handler URL validation rejects every URL form, including loopback and `file:` URLs, rather than trying to allow a safe subset.
- **Parameter gates use own-property lookups** — `hasOwn()` replaces an inherited-property check, so `__proto__`, `constructor` or `toString` cannot slip past an `additionalProperties` or dispatch gate, matching the native `TMap` lookup.
- **Token resolution and log redaction on the TypeScript side** — the bridge re-reads the token file on every `bridge_hello` and fails closed when it cannot resolve one, and `AutomationLogger` redacts tokens, paths and handshake metadata rather than trusting callers to keep them out.

- **A refused call no longer eats the caller’s consent grant** — the pre-queue gate burned a single-use consent nonce BEFORE the handler ran, so a call the handler then refused (a misspelled component name, a path that resolved to nothing) spent the grant on work that never happened; the retry came back `CONSENT_REUSED` and the caller had to re-run describe for a nonce, for a call that changed nothing. The burn now registers against the request and the single response funnel hands it back on failure and forgets it on success, so replay protection is unchanged: a grant that actually did something stays spent.
- **The param-scoped describe mints a consent grant too** — `describe {tool, action}` returned a contract plus a single-use `consentGrant.nonce`, while `describe {tool, action, param}` returned the per-parameter schema and no grant at all, even though it names the same capability under the same consent policy.
- **A cold-boot session cannot be rehydrated without the capability token** — `ValidateSession` rehydrated a session id predating the current transport instance without checking any credential, so a session id surviving a transport restart was accepted on its own. The plugin is the sole authority for auth and re-enforces it on this path as on every other.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🛠️ Fixed</b></summary>

#### Component trees and struct members

- **`attachTo` in a batched `edit_scs` actually attaches.** The parent search matched the requested name against the *exported text* of an `FSubobjectDataHandle` — an opaque id that never contains a component name — so it always fell through to the first handle it had, the root. Fourteen body parts landed on the collision cylinder while every op reported success. The parent is now resolved by name after the node exists, and an `attachTo` that cannot be resolved fails that op with a reason instead of being dropped.
- **Inherited components are addressable from the batch path.** A Blueprint's own SCS is only half its component tree: anything inherited from a native parent (ACharacter's `Mesh`, `CapsuleComponent`, `CharacterMovement`) lives on the CDO with no `USCS_Node`. `modify_component` answered "Component not found or template missing" for components the Blueprint plainly has, and `reparent_scs_component` answered `SCS_PARENT_NOT_FOUND` for a reparent the editor does with a drag. Both now resolve through the CDO, and a node parented to a native component records it the way the editor does.
- **`add_struct_member` honours the `members` array its own contract declares.** Only the single `memberName`/`memberType` pair was ever read, so the array form was refused with `MISSING_PARAMETER` and a ten-field struct cost ten calls. The array is validated as a whole — a bad entry refuses the batch rather than half-building a struct, because a partially applied member list is worse than none.

#### Editor capture, actor search and graph authoring

- **`control_editor.screenshot` can photograph a minimized editor again.** The window enumeration filtered minimized windows out entirely, so once the editor minimized itself (it does so on launch and after some PIE cycles) the main frame was absent from `windows[]` and unaddressable by index *or* title: `full_editor_window` answered `EDITOR_WINDOW_NOT_FOUND` with an empty window list and no in-tool way back. Minimized windows are now listed with `isMinimized`, and a minimized capture target is restored with `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` + `SWP_NOACTIVATE` before the capture so it never steals the user's focus or cursor; the response reports `windowRestored`.
- **`control_editor.take_screenshot` with `mode: "game_viewport"` no longer answers `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.** The UI handler gates on the payload's own `subAction`, which still carried whichever alias the caller used, so the published `take_screenshot` spelling fell past the screenshot branch. The forward now names the canonical action.
- **`control_actor.find_actors_by_class` refuses a class name that does not resolve** instead of reporting "Found 0 actors". A Blueprint short name such as `BP_Thing_C` read as an empty level rather than as the typo it was; the refusal is `CLASS_NOT_FOUND` and names the generated-class path form that works.
- **`add_node` resolves the StandardMacros aliases that `create_node` already did.** `ForEachLoop`, `ForLoop`, `DoOnce`, `Gate` and friends are Blueprint macros, not `UK2Node_*` classes, so the same `nodeType` answered `UNSUPPORTED_NODE` on one action and succeeded on the other.
- **An unknown container type says how containers are spelled.** `TArray<Text>` and `Text[]` — the spellings a C++ author reaches for — produced a bare `Unknown type`, with no hint that the resolver takes `Array<T>`, `Set<T>` and `Map<Key,Value>`.
- **`set_widget_layout` applies every canvas-geometry field the call carries.** `layoutProperty` selects which one names the variant; `position`, `size` and `zOrder` sent together used to have two of the three silently dropped, so a widget landed in the right place at the default size behind everything else. The response lists what was `applied`.

#### Cinematics, render and replay

- Replay seek and killcam responses now wait for measured completion instead of returning optimistically.
- Movie Render Queue ownership is preserved through cancellation and held until executor settlement.
- Take Recorder panel/source state is restored after asynchronous start failures.
- Render limits are validated before queue mutation rather than after.
- Render output proof is token-aware, so tokenized output filenames verify correctly.

#### Engine compatibility

- **Source compatibility restored across the supported UE 5.0–5.8 range.** Several engine APIs and relocated headers were used without guards, and several existing guards named the wrong engine boundary, so the plugin failed to compile on parts of the range it advertises. Header selection now probes with `__has_include` instead of hard-coded version numbers wherever the engine moved a header, and the remaining guards were corrected against the engine source. Affected areas: the StructUtils headers, `FAssetCompilingManager::FinishCompilationForObjects`, `UWidgetBlueprint::WidgetVariableNameToGuidMap`, `CreateNewIKRigAsset`, `FString::RightChopInline`/`LeftInline`, and `PhysicsEngine/SkeletalBodySetup.h`. A redundant `UObject/StrProperty.h` include was dropped (`FStrProperty` comes from the already-included `UObject/UnrealType.h`). Three further shims were added for APIs that differ across the supported range (`MCP_SET_ENUMS`, `MCP_HAS_GET_OBJECTS_FLAGS`/`MCP_GET_OBJECTS_NO_NESTED`, `MCP_DISALLOW_SHRINKING`), and the `MCP_HAS_IKRETARGETER_SET_IKRIG_ENUM` guard was reversed because the boundary it named sat on the wrong minor.
- **JSON key-type change handled across the plugin** — 14 files move from `FJsonObject::Values` lookups with an `FString` key to `HasField()`, the ambiguous `TEXT("ReadOnly")` comparison is qualified, and the diagnostics filename no longer trips C2084.
- **Fab API conformance** — the adapter follows the engine's current Fab API surface, and `bCompileForEdit` (a member added in 5.6, absent on 5.5) is guarded in the shared Niagara stack-issue collector.
- **Render console handler** — use `FJsonObject::HasField()` instead of `Values.Contains(FString)`, following the `FJsonObject::Values` key-type change.
- **Asset soft-path fallback returned the wrong string shape** — `MCP_ASSET_DATA_GET_SOFT_PATH` used `PackageName` (`/Game/Foo`) where callers expected an object path (`/Game/Foo.Foo`). It now uses `FAssetData::ObjectPath`, the equivalent of the `GetSoftObjectPath()` used in the other branch.
- **Clean build fixed** — the memreport scan passed `256` as a seventh argument to `IFileManager::FindFilesRecursive`, but that parameter is `bClearFileNames`, not a result ceiling, so the call did not compile. The bound was dropped rather than reworked: truncating is also wrong here, since picking the newest of an arbitrary subset can miss the actual newest report. A real traversal bound would need `IterateDirectoryStatRecursively`.
- **Last source warning cleared** — `FLinearColor ColorValue;` left its channels uninitialized in the material-parameter track handler, and the only writer runs on one branch, so the compiler could not correlate the write with the guarded use and warned C4701. Seeded to opaque black, matching `ReadLinearColor`'s own defaults.

- **UE 5.8 string-literal compilation in the Fab module** — `McpFabAddToProject.cpp` failed to compile against UE 5.8’s stricter string-literal handling. Contributed by [@punal100](https://github.com/punal100) in [#639](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/639).

#### Handlers and routing

- **Asset listing accepted the wrong field name** — the asset-listing resource read `directory` where its schema declares `path`; the declared name now works.
- **`validate_niagara_system` reports real errors** — it previously hard-coded `isValid=true`. It now builds a full Niagara system view model and harvests stack issues (e.g. "The module has unmet dependencies.") across the system and emitter stacks. A data-processing-only view model cannot be used because `UNiagaraStackModuleItem::RefreshIssues()` emits no per-module issues in that mode.
- **IK Rigs created on the `NewObject` fallback path are registered with the asset registry** — `FAssetRegistryModule::AssetCreated()` is now called explicitly on that branch, which the static factory does for us on engines that have it. Without it the rig existed on disk but was unregistered, so it never appeared in the Content Browser until an unrelated rescan happened to pick it up: the asset looked lost even though creation had reported success.
- **Widget GUID registration logs a truthful no-op** — `RegisterWidgetGuid`, `UnregisterWidgetGuid`, and `RegisterAnimationGuid` each logged "registered"/"unregistered" on engine versions that have no `WidgetVariableNameToGuidMap`, claiming work they had not done. On those versions the engine owns the widget variable's GUID in `UBlueprint::NewVariables[].VarGuid`, and writing our own would overwrite a value existing bindings resolve through — so a no-op is correct, it just has to say so.
- **Bare `remove_variable` / `rename_variable` match on the native transport** — the Blueprint variable removal/rename handler matched only the `blueprint_`-prefixed forms, so the bare action names fell through unhandled. Both the snake_case (`remove_variable`, `rename_variable`) and alphanumeric-lowered (`removevariable`, `renamevariable`) bare forms are now accepted alongside the prefixed ones.
- **Every texture call was failing** — `action` is injected by the consolidated routing layer (`WithPayloadSubAction`) as the legacy dispatch verb, but it is not a client parameter and was absent from the handlers' `ValidParams` allowlists, so schema-valid texture calls were rejected with `TEXTURE_ERROR: Invalid parameter: action`. Added to all five affected handlers (gradient, noise, normal, pattern, resize).
- **`ListenPorts` drop warning** — when multi-listen is on and a partial `ListenPorts` override omits a default bridge port (8090/8091), a warning is logged instead of the drop being silent. The user's ports stay authoritative.
- **TS and native responses share one frame shape** — `normalizeAutomationFrame()` gives the TypeScript bridge the native `structuredContent` envelope, which fixed closed-output-schema failures across the whole 379-record catalog.
- **Blueprint macro nodes and material roots resolve correctly** — `ForLoop`, `ForLoopWithBreak`, `WhileLoop` and `ForEachLoop` were removed from the `K2Node_*` alias map (`ForEachLoop` was wrongly aliased to `K2Node_ForEachElementInEnum`), so the bare names reach the bridge and `TryCreateMacroNode` builds a real `K2Node_MacroInstance`. Material root targets (`root`, `output`, `materialoutput`, `materialgraphnoderoot`, `…_Root_<n>`) canonicalize to one sentinel with normalized output-pin casing for `connect_nodes`, and `propertyValue` is accepted as an alias of `value`.
- **Domain fixes surfaced by the sweep** — a property conversion that cannot coerce now answers `PROPERTY_CONVERSION_FAILED` with `partial: true` for the fields it did apply, unknown World Partition actions answer `UNKNOWN_ACTION` instead of falling through, `modify_scs` reaches the property-applying implementation, `advance_simulation` advances `steps` ticks once instead of `steps` squared, `simplify_mesh` no longer divides by zero on an empty mesh, and the pipeline status report states what it measured instead of a hardcoded value.

#### Live-editor sweep (2026-09-16 to 09-18)

- **A compile no longer pins a dead world** — the editor died with "Fatal World Leaks" several calls *after* the compile that caused it: compiling a Blueprint reinstances its live instances, the originals become garbage, and anything of them still sitting in the transaction buffer keeps the owning world alive. The first full GC — which the game itself triggers on its first `OpenLevel` — then took the whole editor down. The buffer is now cleared at the compile, but only when that Blueprint is actually pinned (the undo buffer references it, or it had live instances). Losing undo history beats losing the editor, and the receipt says which happened and why.
- **`add_node` no longer wires unrelated nodes into `Event Tick`** — a graph-wide exec-link sweep ran after *every* `add_node`, walking every node in the graph and connecting any `VariableSet` or `CallFunction` with a free exec input to the graph’s "preferred event". Adding one node could silently hang nodes the caller never mentioned off `Event Tick` or `Event PreConstruct`; the only trace was an `execLinked` boolean the gateway projects away. In a live project this put an `Add to Viewport` with a null target on `Event Tick`, logging a Blueprint runtime error every frame in PIE.
- **A synthetic click actually presses the button** — `mouse_click` reached the right widget and reported `handledBySlate: true` while the button never fired. Slate recomputes hover every frame from the *real* cursor, so a hover set by a separate `mouse_move` call was gone before the next request arrived, and `SButton` only raises `OnClicked` when the release lands on a widget it still considers hovered. The click now carries its own move in the same dispatch and borrows the hardware cursor for the press/release, putting it straight back where the person left it — a single-frame blip rather than parking the cursor on the target, which is what made automation unusable alongside other work.
- **`add_scs_component` routes through one implementation** — it had THREE payload readers (the batch `operations[]` path, `HandleScsAddComponent`, and a third copy inside `HandleBlueprintScsWrappers` that sat earlier in the route table and so answered every call). The wrapper read only `parent_component`/`parentComponent`, so `attachTo` was dropped and a component asked for `attachTo: "Mesh"` still landed on the collision cylinder, reported as success. Verified live: `attachTo: "Mesh"` on a Character now reports parent `Mesh`/`CharacterMesh0`.
- **Attaching to inherited components works** — parent resolution searched SCS nodes only, so on a Character every spelling of the inherited capsule and mesh failed. "Attach a weapon, light or camera to the character’s skeletal mesh" is the most common Blueprint task there is and it had no reachable path.
- **`MacroInstance` is refused instead of building a broken node** — `nodeType: "MacroInstance"` is the node *class*, not a macro; it fell through to the generic path, spawned a `UK2Node_MacroInstance` with no macro graph attached, and reported "Node created." on a Blueprint that no longer compiled. The spellings that actually resolve (`ForEachLoop`, `ForLoop`, `WhileLoop` and friends) are now named, and nothing is built otherwise.
- **`CreateWidget` nodes carry their class** — both authoring paths wrote a `WidgetType` UPROPERTY that `UK2Node_CreateWidget` does not have, so the reflection write did nothing while the call answered "Node added"; the Blueprint then failed to compile with "Spawn node Create Widget must have a class specified". The class lives on the node’s `Class` input pin, which is now written and reconstructed.
- **`GetVariable` nodes bind their member** — `add_node` with `nodeType: "GetVariable"` reported success and a `nodeGuid` and produced a node with ZERO pins, because the schema publishes `memberName` and the handler read `variableName`; any later `connect_pins` then failed with `PIN_NOT_FOUND`, pointing at the wrong problem.
- **Behavior Tree authoring no longer crashes the editor** — `SpawnMissingNodes()` was called on an already-populated graph, which the engine only ever does from `OnCreated()`; a BTGraph with no nodes (exactly what authoring a tree over the bridge produces) also hard-asserted.
- **Landscapes are created with components** — `create_landscape` produced an `ALandscape` with ZERO components: no geometry, bounds, collision or surface to sculpt, paint or stand on. `ALandscape::Import()` is what allocates the `ULandscapeComponent`s; `SetHeightData()` only writes into components that already exist.
- **Volumes are created with real extents** — the box brush was built on a volume whose `UModel`/`UPolys` had never been allocated, so every volume came out with bounds `{0,0,0}`: a `NavMeshBoundsVolume` enclosing no navigable area, a `PostProcessVolume` affecting nothing.
- **Writes that persist instead of echoing** — `set_world_settings` wrote the transient `WorldGravityZ` cache and enabled the override without touching `GlobalGravityZ`, discarding the requested value *and* pinning world gravity to 0; `create_interactable` accepted a full door/chest behaviour spec and stored none of it; interaction widget/component settings, switch and trigger config, `edit_blackboard.add_key`’s `baseObjectClass`, `create_skeleton`’s `name` and `paint_foliage_instances`’ `radius`/`density` were all accepted and dropped.
- **Struct and DataTable round-tripping** — every struct authored over MCP carried a permanent junk `MemberVar_0` that appeared in every row built on it; `update_row` replaced instead of merging, so a call setting two fields silently wiped the other thirteen, from an action whose name promises the opposite.
- **Closed output contracts stopped hiding handler data** — a field a handler emits but its record does not declare is projected away in silence, which accounted for a whole class of "the data is missing" findings where the data was never missing: sequence `add_actors`/`remove_actors` results and counts, `blueprint.get_scs` inherited components, `blueprint.connect_pins` pin names/types and `saved`, material node placement telemetry (including `overlappingNodes` and `placementWarning`, previously wired to three handlers out of sixteen), and `invoke_function`’s resolved target and `value`.
- **Success is no longer reported over a no-op** — `configure_volume` with properties the class does not carry, a `.t3d` import that imported nothing, a legacy input mapping removal that matched nothing, `add_foliage`’s `scatter` variant (which creates a `UFoliageType` and places zero instances), and UMG animation looping (which has no persisted setting at all — looping is a `PlayAnimation()` argument) each answered success while doing nothing.
- **`inspect` reads Blueprint variable defaults from the CDO** — `FBPVariableDescription::DefaultValue` is a legacy string that stays empty for every variable whose value was written to the CDO, which is where the Blueprint actually stores it.
- **Niagara module stack errors reach `warnings[]`** — `add_niagara_module` reported status `success` with an empty `warnings[]` while parking `stackErrors: ["The module has unmet dependencies."]` in details.
- **Texture create actions accept the folded `kind` discriminator** — the handlers validate against an explicit allowlist and `kind` was missing from all five, so the variant discriminator every caller of a folded action must send was rejected.
- **`save` is published on the struct and DataTable write actions** — both handlers had always read it; no capability record declared it, so no caller could reach working native support.
- **Mojibake repaired in source comments** — the same Windows-1252 round-trip that mangled `CHANGELOG.md` left double-encoded em dashes in 24 places across 13 files.

- **The bridge reports its target, and resolves the project’s own port** — a `NOT_CONNECTED` failure did not say what it had tried to reach, and a project that does not pin `MCP_AUTOMATION_PORT` was not consulted for its own setting. `readProjectListenPort()` now reads the first `ListenPorts` token from the project config (the plugin binds every configured token in order and a busy port silently drops out of the set, so the first token is the one to trust), and `describeBridgeFailure()` classifies the cause from structured transport codes rather than message text, which a peer controls.

#### Fab asset store

- **Fab search no longer hides results** — the search call was pinned to `channels=unreal-engine`, which hid the whole Megascans library; the pin is gone, so the public catalog is discoverable and importability is settled at add time instead.
- **`add_fab_asset_to_project` claims the listing first** — it performs a real `POST /add-to-library` (the same change Fab's own UI makes when you press Add to Project) because Fab answers 404 for a download the account does not own; it then picks the first importable format, and success is decided by the asset registry rather than by Fab's response.
- **Typed Fab failures** — `FAB_NOT_READY`, `FAB_REJECTED`, `NO_IMPORTABLE_FORMAT` and `IMPORT_TIMED_OUT` replace generic refusals, so a caller can tell a missing Fab plugin from a rejected download, an unimportable format, or an import that ran out of time.

- **Gateway-mode opt-outs and the legacy 23-tool listing (permanent single-tool cutover).** The TypeScript `MCP_GATEWAY_MODE` env var and the native **Enable Native Gateway** (`bEnableNativeGateway`) project setting are both gone. The private 23-parent dispatch and legacy action mappings stay inside `unreal.execute`. `MCP_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_MODE` is unaffected — it remains a separate WebSocket client/server topology control.
- **Superseded TypeScript modules** — the root-level `src/tools/consolidated-tool-handlers.ts`, `property-dictionary.ts`, `tool-definition-utils.ts`, `src/tools/editor.ts`, `src/tools/level.ts`, `src/tools/schemas/core-tools.ts`, and the monolithic `src/tools/handlers/*-handlers.ts` set, all replaced by the catalog and per-domain directories. `src/tools/orchestration/consolidated-tool-handlers.ts` survives as the bootstrap/export facade, and `src/tools/dynamic/dynamic-tool-manager.ts` is still live: gateway availability and the execute static stage both gate on `isToolEnabled()`, `configure` mutates it, and it backs the local `manage_tools` category state rather than a per-tool public listing.
- **Superseded plugin sources** — the per-tool `McpTool_*.cpp` definitions, `McpDynamicToolManager.cpp`, `McpConsolidatedActionRouting.h`, and the `McpNativeTransport.{h,cpp}` monolith.
- **Dead code sweep (2026-09-05)**: the legacy `src/tools/editor/` and `src/tools/level/` class modules (only their own unit tests imported them; the live paths are `src/tools/handlers/editor` and `src/tools/handlers/level`), the orphan `src/tools/handlers/niagara/` handler (Niagara authoring is served by `effect/effect-niagara-actions.ts`), the stale `material-authoring-types.ts` copy of `material-authoring-common.ts`, the unused `src/types/index.ts` and `src/utils/index.ts` barrels, 33 exported functions and constants with no callers, the security PoC harness under `tests/unit/_poc_security/`, the orphan `evidence-aggregator.mjs`, the `.jules/` sentinel notes for code that no longer exists, and the `lint:c` / `lint:csharp` npm scripts. The generated `McpNativeGatewayManifest.h` (298 KB, never included by any translation unit since the native gateway moved to the generated registry) is no longer emitted; `generate-gateway-manifest.ts` now writes only the TypeScript and JSON manifests.
- **Deep cleanup continuation (2026-09-06)**: `UnrealCommandQueue` lost its unused `retryPolicy` recovery path (no caller ever passed one; a failed command is never re-run), the retired `route:effect:shadowed_stubs` disposition and its `EFFECT_MODULE_ROUTING` evidence path are gone (76 non-public routes, 7 typed removals), the unused `UE_EDITOR_EXE` / `UE_SCREENSHOT_DIR` env keys and the `src/types/tools/tool-*.ts` type modules were dropped, `toFiniteNumber` moved into `type-coercion.ts`, record builders share `SCHEMA_URI`, `V5_0`, `V5_8_P1` and the `str`/`num`/`bool` schema props, and generator scripts share `writeManifestTargets`. `docs/handler-mapping.md` names the files that actually own the foliage, property and sequence-metadata handlers.
- **Second removal pass (2026-09-06)**: the never-wired semantic value grammars (`semantic/frame-time.ts`, `geometry.ts`, `pagination.ts`, their parse helpers and the schema-only test) are gone; `save-policy.ts` and `property-assignment.ts` keep only the schemas the envelope and execution-options modules actually import. Dead exports dropped: `resolveAlias`, `PrimitiveHandler`, `AutomationMessageSchema`, `VerbFamily`, the unused per-parent record aliases, three `z.infer` aliases in execution-options and the six unused `*Response` interfaces. `animation_physics.list_bones` now declares the bone objects the plugin really emits (name, index, parentIndex, parentName, location) instead of `string[]`, so the gateway no longer refuses its result.
- The `typescript@^6` `overrides` block in `package.json`, alongside the toolchain pinning described under *Dependencies*.
- **The experimental in-editor ACP assistant panel is gone.** The separate assistant plugin subtree was removed from this tree and ships in no release; it survives only on feature branches. External consumers that drove the editor through it must target the native `/mcp` surface or the TypeScript stdio `unreal` gateway instead.
- **Superseded repo files (2026-09-06 and later)** — `GEMINI.md`, the root `mcp-config-example.json` and `claude_desktop_config_example.json` (with their `.github/labeler.yml` globs), `tests/heartbeat-progress.test.mjs`, `tests/integration/get_ai_info_characterization.mjs`, `tests/unit/tools/level_security.test.ts`, the unreferenced `Public/Plugin_setup_guide.mp4`, and the local-only `docs/native-automation-progress.md` progress log.

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ Migration</b></summary>

- **Direct canonical tool calls are breaking.** Any client calling a canonical name directly (`tools/call` with `name: "manage_asset"`, `name: "control_actor"`, …) now receives a `DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` receipt instead of a result. Update call sites to the `unreal` gateway: `search` to find capabilities, `describe` for the exact action/parameter contract, then `execute` with `tool`, `action`, and `params`. There is no opt-out — `MCP_GATEWAY_MODE` and **Enable Native Gateway** are removed and there is no legacy listing to restore. The receipt's `nextCall` is executable and re-runs the original request through the gateway.
- **`manage_post_process` is folded into `manage_render`.** The `Render/McpAutomationBridge_RenderPostProcess*.cpp` files dispatch through `manage_render`; any client calling `manage_post_process` directly now fails with `does not match prefix`. Switch to `manage_render` and pass the desired sub-action via `subAction`. The reflection-capture resolution setter was renamed from `configure_capture_resolution` to `configure_reflection_capture_resolution`; the scene-capture path keeps the original name. `McpAutomationBridge_RenderHandlers.cpp` is now a 74-line dispatcher, with per-concern handlers under `Render/McpAutomationBridge_Render*.cpp`.
- **`control_actor` spawn with an unresolvable `meshPath` now fails.** A request that previously still produced a spawned actor and a success response now returns `MESH_NOT_FOUND` and spawns nothing.
- **Node.js `>=20.19.0` is required.** Node 18 is no longer supported.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🧪 Tests & CI</b></summary>

- **CI gate order is now asserted** by `tests/unit/workflow_gate_order_contract.test.ts`. The pipeline runs: `eslint --max-warnings=0` → `type-check` → `test:unit` → `registry:check` → `normalization:check` → `manifest:check` → `policy:check` → `test:params` → `migration:check` → `primitives:check` → `security:check` → `eval:check` → `version:check` → `workflow:check`, then a blocking `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` and an informational full-tree audit. A second matrix job (Node 20.19.x + 26.x) adds `build` + `test:smoke`.
- **Source-contract tests** in `tests/unit/plugin/*contracts.test.ts` read the C++ as text and assert required and forbidden patterns: pure-line ceilings, resolvable `Mcp*` includes, absence of split artifacts, constant-time token comparison, and no non-loopback bind without `bRequireCapabilityToken`.
- **Plugin-failure detection is word-bounded and content-scoped** — the generic indicator list that still includes the word `unknown` is unchanged, but a separate hard short-circuit list (which does not) runs before it, and the broad list now scans only the message and error strings rather than the whole response body, so a legitimate dispatcher message such as `"Unknown subAction."` no longer reads as a plugin crash. Real plugin errors are already caught by `isError: true` / `structuredContent.success: false`.
- **The test runner propagates failures via `throw`, not `process.exit(1)`** — it still sets `process.exitCode = 1`, but the error is rethrown so wrappers catching via `try`/`catch` or `Promise.all` see the underlying failure. Consumers that relied on the runner terminating the process from a `catch` block should switch to the rethrow contract.
- Added a `scripts/ci/unreal-job-gate.mjs` job gate and `scripts/qa/` adversarial, cross-transport-matrix, and capability-metadata audits.
- **The integration harness drives the gateway** — `tests/test-runner.mjs` exports `toGatewayCall()`, which rewrites every legacy `{tool, action}` case into an `unreal.execute` call (gateway options lifted into `options`, `action`/`subAction`/`params`/`consent` stripped out of `params`, case-level consent attached as the execute envelope sibling, all timeouts clamped to a 600 s ceiling). Assertions and capture selection moved to `tests/test-runner-response-utils.mjs`, and a missing `${captured:...}` value now throws instead of substituting a placeholder.
- **Crash detection is bounded** — the runner's crash and connection-loss signals moved from substring lists to word-boundary and bounded regexes (`hasCrashConnectionSignal`), with the bare `1006` code dropped as a standalone indicator and explicit close-code and not-connected matches added.
- **New test tiers and gate composition** — `security:check` runs `tests/unit/security` plus `tests/unit/adversarial`, `migration:check` also runs the gateway migration doc contract, and the suite gained adversarial fuzz/shrink/soak harnesses, evidence oracles, engine certification and readiness records, live drivers, cross-transport checks including dist freshness, and an offline native-discovery harness that compiles the real `McpNativeGateway*` sources and generated shards against a minimal engine shim.
- **Doc claims are machine-checked** — `tests/unit/docs/docs-claim-contract.test.ts` audits every published doc and the unreleased section of both changelogs against stale-claim rules (retired public tool surface, the removed in-editor assistant panel, unsupported protocol versions, unbacked certification and engine-range claims, stale capability-record counts), each with a negative control that proves the rule can fail.
- **CI job topology** — an opt-in `package-plugin` job (gated on the engine-root repo variable, with `MCP_STRICT_DEPRECATIONS=1`) and an opt-in `live-matrix` job (which builds and runs the Unreal integration suite on a labelled runner) join the always-on `unreal-optional-status` job that announces which Unreal-dependent jobs were skipped and why; four workflow contract tests plus the release-archive contract guard the pipeline.
- **Packaging writes a SHA-256 manifest and hardens the archive** — `scripts/lib/package-manifest.mjs` writes `McpAutomationBridge-v<version>-UE<engine>-<platform>.manifest.json` beside the archive, the archive additionally excludes `.cache/` and `DerivedDataCache/` and prunes `*.pdb`, `*.debug`, `*.sym` and `*.dSYM`, and a post-archive check fails the build if a generated build directory slipped in.

- **The catalog-import case got a timeout that fits it** — "inspect_cdo is in the tool schema action enum" cold-imports the generated catalog (the consolidated tool definitions plus all 380 records) inside the test body. That import alone runs past the 10s default under full-suite load, so the case failed on timing rather than content: it passed whenever the file was run on its own and failed in `npm run test:unit` regardless of what the rest of the change touched. Raised to 30s with the reason recorded beside it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📚 Documentation</b></summary>

- **21 `AGENTS.md` files (20 area guides plus the root workspace guide)** now cover the tree: catalog, tools, handlers, gateway, MCP primitives, server, automation, utils, resources, types, plugin scope, plugin core/domains/safety/native-MCP/foundation/transport, tests, and the two test-area guides (`tests/unit/plugin/`, `tests/unit/mcp-primitives/`).
- **Gateway migration and protocol docs** — the permanent single-`unreal` surface on both transports (the former `MCP_GATEWAY_MODE` and **Enable Native Gateway** toggles were removed, not merely defaulted off), the `DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` receipt, `2025-11-25` negotiation with the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header guard, and the manifest generate/`--check` workflow.
- Published a generated action reference, migration map, and capability support matrix from the capability records.
- **The `bump-version` workflow rewrites all seven version sources** — `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, `server.json`, `McpAutomationBridge.uplugin`, `Resources/MCP/server-info.json`, the `src/server/server-factory.ts` fallback and the `McpNativeTransport.h` `ServerVersion` literal, then verifies with `npm ci && npm run version:check`. Release and plugin archives exclude `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, `.cache/` and `DerivedDataCache/`, prune debug symbols, and fail the build when a generated build directory survives into the archive.

<summary><b>✅ Verification</b></summary>

- **Supports Unreal Engine 5.0–5.8.** The range is a source-compatibility target: per-version build and live-editor results are not asserted here. See [docs/performance-and-evidence.md](docs/performance-and-evidence.md) for the engine matrix and what each version's record actually shows.
- **Live-editor acceptance is not claimed for the TypeScript gateway build.** Gateway behavior, `2025-11-25` negotiation, manifest generation, and parity/parameter audits are verified through source-contract tests and the build, not against a running Unreal Editor. The integration suite (`npm test`) requires a live editor plus the bridge plugin and runs only in the opt-in `live-matrix` CI job; it is skipped by default rather than excluded. Do not treat any unexecuted live-editor proof as verified.

<summary><b>👥 Contributors</b></summary>

Special thanks to everyone who shipped code in this release window, with author aliases collapsed. Contributors whose work merged after the `v0.5.30` tag but is already credited in the 0.5.30 section below are not repeated here.

- **Editor-correctness sweep (the largest body of work in this release):** @SoloGorilla for ~70 commits across the inspect, actor, blueprint, material, metasound, PCG and asset handlers. Highlights: calls that reported success while dropping the write (`set_component_property`, `set_camera` discarding the requested position, material vector values written as opaque white), engine-ensure and editor-crash guards, path refusals that name the rule instead of always blaming traversal, pin and array summaries that say where they were cut, and UE 5.5/5.8 build guards (clang, `SetEnums`, the deprecated `ForEachObjectWithPackage` overload, `bCompileForEdit`, IWYU include regroup).
- **UE 5.8 support and bridge configuration:** @alecray for the `FJsonObject::Values` key-type build fix, the `MCP_NATIVE_PORT` override, a warning when `ListenPorts` silently drops a default bridge port (8090/8091), transactional `control_actor` spawn that rolls back on mesh failure, and unmet-dependency detection in `validate_niagara_system`.
- **Blueprint variable and event authoring:** @mhsm555 for component-bound events in `add_event` (#483), `targetClass` on DynamicCast nodes (#478), and `defaultValue` actually applied when adding variables (#475).
- **Native transport stability:** @vladSirin for moving the SSE notification keepalive onto a dedicated thread so it survives GameThread stalls (#491), and the UE 5.8 `FJsonObject` shared-string key build fix (#574).
- **Blueprint node safety:** @Fl0p for preventing an editor crash when creating `ConstructObjectFromClass`/`SpawnActorFromClass` nodes (#500), and for routing bare `remove_variable`/`rename_variable` on the native transport (#590).
- **Bridge targeting and Fab:** @punal100 for reporting the bridge target and resolving the project's bridge port (#640), and UE 5.8 Fab string-literal compilation fixes (#639).
- **Engine and compiler compatibility:** @max-modum for guarding pre-5.4/5.5 APIs so the plugin builds on older engines, verified on 5.3 (#493), and @TerryRouse02 for the C4800 enum-to-bool conversion in `IsStructureValid` (#562).
- **Dependency and workflow updates:** @dependabot[bot].

## 🏷️ [0.5.30] - 2026-06-05

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🚀 Native MCP & Code-Backed Tool Parity Release
> This release covers the `v0.5.21` to `0.5.30` release diff, including the TypeScript MCP server, native bridge plugin, tests, scripts, docs, workflows, and dependency manifests. The summary below is based on code and test changes, not commit subjects alone.

<details>
<summary><b>✨ Added</b></summary>

- **Native MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint** — added an opt-in in-plugin `/mcp` server with JSON-RPC 2.0 initialize/tools/list/tools/call handling, POST/GET/DELETE routing, `Mcp-Session-Id` session tracking, SSE tool-result streaming, progress notifications, persistent notification streams, `notifications/tools/list_changed` broadcasts, CORS handling, loopback-first binding, capability-token checks, and an editor status-bar indicator.
- **Self-describing native MCP tools** — added C++ `FMcpToolRegistry`, `FMcpSchemaBuilder`, `MCP_REGISTER_TOOL`, canonical native tool filtering, cached schema generation, and native dynamic tool/category enablement for the 23 canonical parent tools.
- **PCG automation** — added `manage_pcg` TypeScript/native schemas and handlers for graph/subgraph creation, PCG node aliases, pin connections, reflected node settings, component/world execution, partition grid configuration, save/overwrite behavior, and PCG plugin availability errors.
- **Environment systems automation** — added build-environment coverage for heightmap import/export, landscape layer info/material/splines/LOD/streaming proxies, foliage type configuration/paint/remove flows, sky and volumetric-cloud setup, weather/wind/time-of-day systems, water bodies, water waves/material/collision, and buoyancy components.
- **Behavior Tree authoring and introspection** — added `add_subnode`, root-sentinel decorators, decorator/service validation, subnode-aware lookup, `FBlackboardKeySelector` assignment, and `get_tree` runtime hierarchy serialization with root decorators, edge decorators, decorator ops, services, key properties, subtree references, and a success-with-null-root contract for graphless trees.
- **Blueprint, property, and inspection tools** — added `inspect_cdo`, Class Default Object component/property export, SCS and inherited SCS component classification, typed Blueprint custom-event pins, Enhanced Input graph nodes, inherited variable/member-class graph node lookup, and property access for Blueprint-added SCS component templates.
- **Editor, world, and input capabilities** — added full editor-window screenshots, game viewport screenshot routing, image content responses, simulated keyboard/mouse input aliases, active camera reporting, PIE runtime inspection, native `get_current_level`, actor material/view-target native actions, spawn scale support, and create-plane height handling.
- **Material, audio, animation, and system actions** — added Material Function creation/editing/calls/info, FunctionInput/FunctionOutput graph support, source-effect chains and source-effect presets, `force_rebuild_blend_space`, legacy/per-key input mapping edits, project setting writes, native asset validation, and `execute_python` for inline or project-local Python files.

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ Security</b></summary>

- **GraphQL attack surface removed** — deleted the GraphQL server, schema/resolver/loaders, GraphQL docs, GraphQL unit tests, and direct GraphQL runtime dependencies.
- **Native MCP exposure controls** — default native MCP binding stays loopback-only unless explicitly allowed; non-loopback hosts warn, sessions are validated, stale requests/streams are cleaned up, and native HTTP requests use explicit request-origin routing instead of socket inference.
- **Capability-token and dynamic-tool protections** — native MCP validates `X-MCP-Capability-Token` when required, while both TypeScript and native dynamic tool managers protect `manage_tools`/`inspect` and protected categories from accidental disablement.
- **Python execution hardening** — `execute_python` enforces code/file exclusivity, a 1 MB inline code limit, project-root path normalization, symlink escape checks, `__file__` setup for file execution, temp-file cleanup, and direct `PythonScriptPlugin` execution.
- **Path, command, log, and workflow hardening** — tightened UE path normalization, console-command validation, snapshot/log path handling, level save/load flows, image/log redaction, safe `tmp/` cleanup, sync-script argument parsing, and GitHub Actions interpolation by moving untrusted values into environment variables.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Changed</b></summary>

- **Release metadata** — updated `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `server.json`, the `src/index.ts` fallback, and `McpAutomationBridge.uplugin` to `0.5.30`.
- **Canonical TypeScript tool surface** — kept the 23 parent tools but moved action lists into shared constants, grouped tools into `core`, `world`, `gameplay`, and `utility`, merged nested `params` into top-level arguments for constrained clients, centralized handler routing, and removed legacy per-domain tool files.
- **Dynamic tool listing** — `tools/list` now checks known client support for `tools.listChanged`; dynamic clients can receive category-filtered tools, while clients without dynamic loading still see the full compatible tool surface.
- **Automation bridge lifecycle** — refactored host/port parsing, multi-port WebSocket connection attempts, handshake metadata, request queueing, progress timeout extension, stale-progress detection, absolute timeout caps, rate/message-size boundaries, disconnect/error tracking, and image-payload redaction.
- **Native bridge runtime** — split request dispatch out of the subsystem, added explicit `ERequestOrigin`, queued requests through the game thread, converted captured engine errors into failed responses, pumped GameThread tasks during native transport shutdown, and exposed native transport session/tool counts to UI.
- **Response and schema handling** — improved response validation, summary text generation, image response content, scalar result promotion, safe JSON cleanup, schema reuse, action-specific parameter descriptions, and stricter error context on tool failures.
- **Plugin compatibility** — updated bridge metadata for UE 5.8 Preview and added PythonScriptPlugin, StructUtils, Synthesis, and PCG plugin declarations where the new handlers need them.
- **Scripts and workflows** — made smoke tests run through SDK `InMemoryTransport`, added native parity/parameter audit npm scripts, changed `clean` to remove `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, added Linux/macOS/Windows plugin packaging scripts, strengthened sync/cleanup scripts, and made CI/publish/release gates stricter.

<details>
<summary><b>🛠️ Fixed</b></summary>

#### Crash Prevention (UE 5.7+)

- **Animation/Rig asset deletion** – Completely rewrote `McpSafeDeleteFolder` and added `DeleteAnimationRigClusterOrdered` to prevent 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF crashes when deleting AnimBlueprints, IKRigs, IKRetargeters, ControlRigBlueprints, and AnimSequences.
- **Folder deletion** – Replaced `UEditorAssetLibrary::DeleteDirectory` with `McpSafeDeleteFolder` (proper world switching, package unloading, compilation quiesce).
- **Blueprint creation** – Added pre‑creation checks in `CreateControlRigBlueprint` and widget blueprint creation to prevent engine assertion failures.
- **Widget creation** – Fixed widget crash ([#306](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/306)) by adding GUID registration (`RegisterWidgetGuid`) and safe tree replacement (`SafeAddWidgetToTree`).
- **AnimNotify/NotifyState** – Added abstract class validation and track existence checks.

#### Asset & Path Handling

- Improved asset loading reliability for newly created AI assets (removed stale `DoesAssetExist` checks).
- Resolved asset query parameter bugs and expanded `classNames` support ([#311](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/311)).
- Replaced custom asset directory checks with `UEditorAssetLibrary` to avoid stale cache issues.
- Fixed `searchText` filtering in `search_assets` action ([#308](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/308)).
- Added `offset` pagination to asset search.

#### Blueprint & Graph Editing

- Unified pin serialization across blueprint graph handlers ([#309](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/309)) – linked pins returned as objects with `nodeId` and `pinName`.
- Improved actor lookup to match subsystem behavior (checks both label and name).
- Aligned `get_ai_info` output with TypeScript schema ([#310](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/310)).

#### Performance & Console

- Delegated console command settings to C++ handler for better performance.
- Ensured successful execution of console commands (check `GEngine->Exec` return value).
- Added validation for required session parameters (interfaceType, controllerId, playerIndex, etc.).
- Removed redundant `AsyncTask` wrappers in `generate_thumbnail` and `generate_lods` (fixed 30‑second timeout).

#### Level Operations

- **`rename_level`** – Now uses `DuplicateAsset` + `DeleteAsset` to avoid modal “Find/Replace” dialog.
- **`duplicate_level`** – Validates source existence and deletes destination if already present.
- **`export_level`** – Added source level existence check before export.

#### Voice Chat & Sessions

- Improved `mute_player` – falls back to `BlockPlayers` when voice server not connected.
- Added validation for required parameters in all session actions.

#### Plugin Stability

- Used delay‑load for optional plugin modules to prevent missing dependency errors ([#317](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/317)).
- Refactored IK retargeter initialization using controller API (UE 5.7+) with backward compatibility fallback.
- Enhanced actor and component stability across subsystems.

#### Documentation

- Fixed rate limiting defaults and missing GraphQL heading ([#307](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp/pull/307)).

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 Landscape Handler Silent Fallback Bug</b> (McpAutomationBridge_LandscapeHandlers.cpp)</summary>

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|------------|-----|
| False positives on non-existent landscapes | Path matching compared `GetPathName()` (internal path) with asset path | Normalized both paths with `.uasset` stripping |
| Silent fallback to single landscape | `if (!Landscape && LandscapeCount == 1)` used any available landscape | Removed fallback, now returns `LANDSCAPE_NOT_FOUND` error |
| Wrong response path | Returned requested path instead of actual path | Now returns `Landscape->GetPackage()->GetPathName()` |

**Affected Handlers:** `HandleModifyHeightmap`, `HandlePaintLandscapeLayer`, `HandleSculptLandscape`, `HandleSetLandscapeMaterial`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 Rotation Yaw Bug</b> (McpAutomationBridge_LightingHandlers.cpp:200)</summary>

**Impact:** `set_curve_key` now correctly reports success.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 CraftingSpeed Truncation</b> (McpAutomationBridge_InventoryHandlers.cpp:2716)</summary>

| Bug | Fix |

| **Severity** | 🚨 HIGH |
| **Loopback Binding** | Automation Bridge now only binds to loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 or ::1) |
| **Handshake Required** | Automation requests require completed `bridge_hello` handshake |

**C++ Plugin:**
- Rejects `0.0.0.0` and `::` bind attempts, falls back to `127.0.0.1` with warning
- Added `AuthenticatedSockets` tracking set in `McpConnectionManager`
- Unauthenticated sockets receive `HANDSHAKE_REQUIRED` error and connection close (code 4004)

**TypeScript Bridge:**
- Added `normalizeLoopbackHost()` to validate and enforce loopback addresses
- Non-loopback host values rejected with warning and fallback

</details>
