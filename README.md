- **Dynamic Type Discovery** — Runtime introspection for lights, debug shapes, and sequencer tracks
- **Graceful Degradation** — Server starts even without an active Unreal connection
- **On-Demand Connection** — Retries automation handshakes with exponential backoff
- **Command Safety** — Blocks dangerous console commands with pattern-based validation
- **Capability Token Auth** — On-by-default token authentication (auto-generated 32-byte secret at `<Project>/Saved/MCP/capability-token`) for both WS and HTTP transports; manual `CapabilityToken` in Project Settings overrides the file
- **Asset Caching** — 10-second TTL for improved performance
- **Metrics Rate Limiting** — Per-IP rate limiting (60 req/min) on Prometheus endpoint
- **Centralized Configuration** — Unified class aliases and type definitions

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.19 or later** (Node.js 18 is not supported) — required for the TypeScript stdio bridge. Not needed for the native MCP transport.

### Step 1: Install MCP Server (Option B only — skip for Native MCP)

> Skip this step if using **Option A: Native MCP Transport** ([Step 4A](#option-a-native-mcp-transport-direct-http--no-bridge-needed) below).

**NPX (Recommended):**
```bash
npx unreal-engine-mcp-server
```

**Clone & Build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp.git
cd Unreal_mcp
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js
```

### Step 2: Install Unreal Plugin

The MCP Automation Bridge plugin is included at `Unreal_mcp/plugins/McpAutomationBridge`.

#### From source (requires a project with code target)

Your project must have a code target (`.sln` or `.xcworkspace`).
Blueprint-only projects cannot compile native plugins — to convert, add any class via **Tools > New C++ Class** in the editor.

**Method 1: Copy Folder**
```text
Copy:  Unreal_mcp/plugins/McpAutomationBridge/
To:    YourUnrealProject/Plugins/McpAutomationBridge/
```

**Method 2: External Plugin Directory (no copy needed)**
1. Open Unreal Editor → **Edit → Plugins**
2. Click **Plugin Directories** (bottom-left)
3. In **Additional Plugin Directories**, add the path to `Unreal_mcp/plugins/`
4. Restart the editor — the plugin will be picked up from the external location

This saves the path in your `.uproject` file so the plugin stays linked without copying.

The plugin compiles automatically when you open the project — UE detects the `.uplugin` + `Source/` and runs UnrealBuildTool.

**Video Guide:**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b86ebc-4364-48c9-9781-de854bf3ef7d

> ⚠️ **First-Time Project Open:** UE may prompt *"Would you like to rebuild them now?"* — click **Yes**. If instead you see *"Missing Modules — McpAutomationBridge. Engine modules cannot be compiled at runtime. Please build through your IDE."* — open your project in **Visual Studio** (Win) or **Xcode** (Mac) and build from there. After that, the editor will open normally with the plugin loaded.

#### Pre-built (works with any project, including Blueprint-only)

Build the plugin once, then distribute the compiled binaries — no IDE or compilation needed on the target machine.

**1. Build:**
```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/package-plugin.sh /path/to/UE_5.6

# Windows
scripts\package-plugin.bat C:\Path\To\UE_5.6
```

This produces a zip like `McpAutomationBridge-v0.5.30-UE5.7-Linux.zip`.

**2. Install:** unzip into `YourProject/Plugins/` and open the project. That's it — no compilation step.

> Note: pre-built binaries are tied to a specific UE version. A build for 5.6 won't work with 5.5, 5.7, or 5.8.

### Step 3: Enable Required Plugins

Enable via **Edit → Plugins**, then restart the editor.

> PCG support is compiled for source projects when the project explicitly enables PCG. Versioned release packages for UE 5.2+ include PCG support. All Unreal Engine versions from 5.0 to 5.8 are supported and working.

### Step 4: Configure MCP Client

#### Option A: Native MCP Transport (Direct HTTP — no bridge needed)

The plugin includes a built-in MCP Streamable HTTP server. AI clients connect directly to the plugin over HTTP — no TypeScript bridge, no Node.js, no npm.
**Note:** the `bAllowNonLoopback` setting now applies to **both** the WebSocket bridge and the native MCP transport. Enabling it binds both surfaces to non-loopback addresses. If you only need LAN access for the WebSocket bridge, do not enable `bAllowNonLoopback` and instead expose the bridge via a reverse proxy. Capability token auth is on by default (0.5.30+) — both transports require authentication automatically. A manually configured `CapabilityToken` in Project Settings or the auto-generated token at `<Project>/Saved/MCP/capability-token` is used automatically.

**Enable in Unreal:**
1. **Edit > Project Settings > Plugins > MCP Automation Bridge**
2. Check **Enable Native MCP**
3. Set port (default: `3000`)
4. Optionally set **Native MCP Instructions** for project-specific guidance
5. Restart the editor

**Configure your MCP client** to use Streamable HTTP transport at:
```
http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add unreal-engine --transport http http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Or manually in `~/.claude/settings.json` or project `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-engine": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-engine": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Verify it works:**
- **Status bar** — look for `● MCP :3000 (2)` in the bottom-right of the editor. Green dot = server running, number in parens = active sessions. Click it to open settings.
- **Output Log** — filter by `LogMcpNativeTransport` to see connections, tool calls, and session activity:
  ```
  LogMcpNativeTransport: Native MCP server started on http://localhost:3000/mcp
  LogMcpNativeTransport: MCP session initialized: ... (client: claude-code 2.1.92, active sessions: 1)
  LogMcpNativeTransport: tools/call: inspect (RequestId=...)
  LogMcpNativeTransport: tools/call completed: ... (tool=inspect, success=true)
  ```

Features:
- SSE streaming for real-time progress during long operations
- Multiple concurrent sessions (Cursor + Claude Code + others simultaneously)
- Dynamic tool management — core tools load by default, enable more via `manage_tools`
- Python execution via `execute_python` action (inline code or .py files)
- Capability token authentication — on by default (auto-generated secret at `<Project>/Saved/MCP/capability-token`; manual `CapabilityToken` in Project Settings overrides)

#### Option B: TypeScript Bridge (stdio — classic setup)

Add to your Claude Desktop / Cursor config file:

**Using Clone/Build:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-engine": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/Unreal_mcp/dist/cli.js"],
      "env": {
        "UE_PROJECT_PATH": "C:/Path/To/YourProject",
        "MCP_AUTOMATION_PORT": "8091"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using NPX:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["unreal-engine-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "UE_PROJECT_PATH": "C:/Path/To/YourProject"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required
UE_PROJECT_PATH="C:/Path/To/YourProject"

# Automation Bridge
MCP_AUTOMATION_HOST=127.0.0.1
MCP_AUTOMATION_PORT=8091

# LAN Access (optional)
# SECURITY: Set to true to allow binding to non-loopback addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0)
# Only enable if you understand the security implications.
MCP_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=false

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info  # debug | info | warn | error

# Optional
MCP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
ASSET_LIST_TTL_MS=10000

# Optional Prometheus metrics endpoint
# Loopback-only by default. Non-loopback metrics requires both explicit opt-in and a token.
# MCP_METRICS_PORT=9100
# MCP_METRICS_HOST=127.0.0.1
# MCP_METRICS_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=false
# MCP_METRICS_TOKEN=change-me

# Custom content mount points (comma-separated)
# Plugins with CanContainContent register mount points beyond /Game/.
# MCP_ADDITIONAL_PATH_PREFIXES=/ProjectObject/,/ProjectAnimation/
```

### LAN Access Configuration

By default, the automation bridge only binds to loopback addresses (127.0.0.1) for security. To enable access from other machines on your network:

**TypeScript (MCP Server):**
```env
MCP_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=true
MCP_AUTOMATION_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

**Unreal Engine Plugin:**
1. Go to **Edit → Project Settings → Plugins → MCP Automation Bridge**
2. Under **Security**, enable **"Allow Non Loopback"**
3. Under **Connection**, set **"Listen Host"** to `0.0.0.0`
4. Restart the editor

⚠️ **Security Warning:** Enabling LAN access exposes the automation bridge to your local network. Only use on trusted networks with appropriate firewall rules. **Enable capability token authentication** (`Require Capability Token` in project settings) to prevent unauthorized access when using LAN mode.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes a single **`unreal`** gateway tool. The 23 canonical parent tools are internal and reachable exclusively through the gateway's four operations: `search`, `describe`, `execute`, and `configure`.

### Gateway Workflow

1. **`search`** — discover available tools by keyword, category, or action name
2. **`describe`** — get the exact contract (actions, parameters, schema) for a specific tool
3. **`execute`** — run one validated action on a canonical tool
4. **`configure`** — manage internal tool enable/disable state (wraps `manage_tools`)

Example call:

```json
{
  "operation": "search",
  "query": "asset"
}
```

Then:

```json
{
  "operation": "describe",
  "tool": "manage_asset",
  "action": "import_asset"
}
```

Then:

```json
{
  "operation": "execute",
  "tool": "manage_asset",
  "action": "import_asset",
  "params": { "sourcePath": "/path/to/asset.fbx", "destinationPath": "/Game/Imported/asset" }
}
```

### Migration from direct tool calls

The single `unreal` gateway is permanent on both transports; there is no opt-out and no legacy 23-tool listing to restore. A client that still calls a canonical tool name directly (`tools/call` with `name: "manage_asset"`, `name: "control_actor"`, etc.) receives a bounded, copy-paste-executable `DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` receipt instead of a routed call. The receipt carries a `nextCall` that drills exactly one level: `{ "operation": "search" }` for an unknown name, `{ "operation": "describe", "tool": "<tool>" }` when no action was supplied, or `{ "operation": "execute", "tool": "<tool>", "action": "<action>", "params": { ... } }` when the direct call already named an action. Run that `nextCall` through the `unreal` tool to finish the migration.

### Gateway Protocol & Transport

Both transports expose the same `unreal` gateway contract, but they are separate lifecycles. Do not route around their boundaries.

- **TypeScript stdio transport** — `node dist/cli.js` talks to the Unreal plugin over a WebSocket bridge. It permanently exposes the single `unreal` gateway tool; there is no gateway-mode toggle.
- **Native MCP transport** — the plugin's built-in Streamable HTTP/SSE server at `/mcp` (no Node.js, no bridge). The native MCP surface permanently exposes the same single `unreal` gateway tool; there is no gateway-mode toggle.

Both surfaces negotiate the MCP protocol version at `initialize`; the supported set is intentionally asymmetric. The native `/mcp` transport supports exactly the three modern versions `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, and `2025-03-26`, and deliberately does not implement the later `2026-07-28` RC. The TypeScript stdio server also accepts the two legacy versions `2024-11-05` and `2024-10-07`, so the native surface is intentionally stricter. Both negotiate down to the highest mutually supported version (`2025-11-25` is the latest). See [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) for the full negotiation and transport contract, including the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header guard (HTTP 400 on invalid), cancellation semantics, and `progressToken` handling.

## Development

```bash
npm run build         # Clean + compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run lint          # Run ESLint 9 (fail on any warning)
npm run type-check    # tsc --noEmit
npm run test:unit     # Vitest unit tests (no Unreal required)
npm run test:smoke    # Offline mock in-memory MCP check (needs built dist/)
npm run manifest:check   # Fail if generated gateway manifest artifacts drift
npm run test:native-parity # TS vs native canonical tool/action equality
npm run test:params      # Parity + strict parameter audit
npm run version:check    # Assert all version sources agree
npm test                 # Integration suite (needs a live Unreal Editor + bridge)
```

### Gateway manifest generation

The neutral gateway manifest is generated from `src/tools/catalog/consolidated-tool-definitions.ts` into three artifacts (runtime `.ts`/`.json` plus the native `.h`). Never hand-edit the generated files.

```bash
node --loader ts-node/esm scripts/generate-gateway-manifest.ts          # regenerate
node --loader ts-node/esm scripts/generate-gateway-manifest.ts --check  # CI gate: fail on drift
```

### CI gates

CI runs, in order: ESLint 9 (`npx eslint . --max-warnings=0`), TypeScript type-check, unit tests, `registry:check`, `normalization:check`, `manifest:check`, `policy:check`, native parity + parameter audit (`test:params`), `migration:check`, `primitives:check`, `security:check`, `eval:check`, `version:check`, `workflow:check`, then a blocking runtime-only dependency audit (`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`) followed by an informational full-tree `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`. A plugin packaging job runs `scripts/package-plugin.sh` only when an Unreal Engine source root secret is provided (opt-in), because CI runners do not ship an engine. Release archives exclude `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, and `Saved/` so generated build dirs never leak.
