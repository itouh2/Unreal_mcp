// src/utils/paths/content-path-policy.ts
// The shared vocabulary for "is this string a safe UE content path / a secret
// argument name", used by the resource, prompt and completion surfaces.
//
// These lived as three near-copies and had already drifted three ways:
//   * resource-errors carried the `u` flag on the host-path regex, prompt-errors
//     did not;
//   * completion-slots additionally rejected `bin|opt|usr`, the other two did not;
//   * the content-root list was spelled twice under two names;
//   * the asset handlers kept a fourth list that caught /proc and /sys and the
//     percent-encoded forms, but only the `c:` drive letter.

// Drift in a REJECTION rule is a security problem — the same input was refused
// on one surface and accepted on another. This module is the union of what the
// three enforced, so consolidating tightens rather than loosens every caller.
//
// Only the vocabulary and the predicates live here. Each surface keeps its own
// throwing wrapper, because each raises its own typed error.

 * True when any segment is `..`, i.e. the value tries to escape its root.
 *
 * Splits on BOTH separators. Two of the three prior copies split on `/` only;
 * this takes the widest (completion-slots') behaviour, so consolidating rejects
 * strictly more than any caller did before. Callers that also run
 * HOST_PATH_PATTERN reject a backslash outright before reaching this.
 *
 * Percent-encoded traversal counts as traversal. Three of the four callers used
 * to miss it: the prompt and completion surfaces test the raw argument and so
 * saw `%2e%2e` as an ordinary name, and the resource reader's single decode
 * turns `%252e%252e` into `%2e%2e` rather than into `..`. Folding the check in
 * here fixes all three at the one place they share, instead of at each caller.
 *
 * It decodes to a fixed point rather than matching known spellings, because a
 * spelling list catches only what is on it: `%2e%2e` and `%252e` were caught,
 * while `/Game/%2e./S`, `/Game/.%2e/S` and `/Game/..%2fS` all decode to
 * `/Game/../S` and all passed. Each round peels one encoding layer; the loop
 * stops when decoding stops changing the string, when it throws on malformed
 * input (which is itself refused), or at MAX_TRAVERSAL_DECODE_ROUNDS.
