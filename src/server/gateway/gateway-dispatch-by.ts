// src/server/gateway/gateway-dispatch-by.ts
// A folded record stands for a family of handler actions that differ only by
// one selector value. Two data fields on the record drive the fold at execute
// time, and nothing else does:
//   routing.dispatchBy    selector value -> bridge action, for a call that names
//                         the primary operation;
//   legacyIds[n].folded   the selector values an old name implied, for a call
//                         that still names the old action (or its alias id).
// Both doors apply the same two steps in the same order: the pins are injected
// before schema validation, the action is chosen after it. The native mirror
// is McpNativeGatewayFolding.cpp.

 * Inject the selector values a folded family pins for an old name. Each pinned
 * selector is one of exactly three cases:
 *   - the caller omitted it           -> inject the pinned value;
 *   - the caller sent the same value  -> keep the caller's value;
 *   - the caller sent a different one -> return undefined (refuse the call).
 * The action the caller named decides dispatch, so an omitted selector is
 * filled in, but a caller-supplied value is never overridden. A legacy caller
 * never sent the selector pre-fold, so a disagreement is a contradictory
 * request, not a legacy call, and must be refused rather than silently
 * dispatched.
