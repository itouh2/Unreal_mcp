// Task 41: the execute-path idempotency seam.
//
// Sits between the gateway's authorization stages and dispatch. Placing it AFTER
// scope/consent/validation is what makes the "never cache a refusal" rule
// structural rather than a promise: a refused request returns before it can
// reach `begin`, so no refusal can ever occupy or replay a slot.
//
// Participation is decided by the CLIENT, not by the capability's declared
// behaviour class: a key dedups whichever capability it was sent to. This
// mirrors the native gate (`if (!Context.IdempotencyId.IsEmpty())`) exactly, and
// it is the only reading that matches what a key is for — an idempotency key
// exists to make a NON-idempotent operation safe to retry, so a class-based gate
// would disable the protection precisely where it is load-bearing.
//
// Consequence, accepted deliberately: a key sent to a read replays that read's
// recorded receipt for the TTL rather than re-reading the editor. That is what
// the client asked for by naming the call with a key, it is opt-in per call, and
// only a successful receipt is ever cacheable.
//
// The fingerprint is computed from the POST-normalization params, so a key
// replayed after defaults/aliases resolved differently is correctly a conflict
// rather than a silent replay of a result the client did not actually ask for.
