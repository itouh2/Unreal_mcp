# src/server

MCP SDK construction, stdio lifecycle, and tool/resource registration. Keep protocol registration here; tool contracts and action implementations remain under `src/tools/`.

## STRUCTURE
```
server/
|-- server-factory.ts              # SDK server, bridges, metrics, output schemas, notifications/cancelled
|-- stdio-lifecycle.ts             # transport startup and idempotent shutdown
|-- tool-registry.ts               # ListTools/CallTool orchestration, single-tool gateway listing
|-- tool-registry-client.ts        # client capability and default-category policy
|-- tool-registry-listing.ts       # filtered, sanitized public tool definitions
|-- tool-registry-manage-tools.ts  # local manage_tools action implementation
|-- tool-registry-elicitation.ts   # missing primitive argument prefill
|-- tool-registry-gateway.ts       # single-tool gateway ENTRY: handleUnrealGatewayCall() operation switch
|-- resource-registry.ts           # resource listing and handler registration
`-- gateway/                 (25)  # gateway ROUTING ENGINE: search/describe/execute pipeline
```
`gateway/` has its own `AGENTS.md`. Do not confuse it with `src/gateway/` (the generated manifest data + loader) — this directory is request routing, that one is the catalog artifact.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | File | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Construct the server | `server-factory.ts` | Wire health, metrics, bridge events, schemas, capabilities |
| Change stdio cleanup | `stdio-lifecycle.ts` | Preserve signal, stdin, and process-exit cleanup paths |
| Change `tools/list` routing | `tool-registry.ts` | Coordinates client policy and sanitized listing; permanently emits the single `unreal` gateway tool |
| Change the single-tool gateway | `tool-registry-gateway.ts` | `unreal` tool exposes `search`/`describe`/`execute`/`configure` operations |
| Change what a model reads before its first call | `../tools/catalog/unreal-gateway-definition.ts` | `UNREAL_GATEWAY_DESCRIPTION` (tool listing) and `UNREAL_GATEWAY_INSTRUCTIONS` (passed to `new Server()` in `server-factory.ts`); native copies are `McpNativeGatewayDefinition.cpp` and `Resources/MCP/server-info.json`, kept byte-equal by `tests/unit/tools/unreal-gateway-guidance-contract.test.ts` |
| Change client compatibility | `tool-registry-client.ts` | `listChanged` support controls category filtering |
| Change `tools/list` sanitization | `tool-registry-listing.ts` | Preserve action enum, required fields, and schema flags from canonical definitions |
| Change `manage_tools` | `tool-registry-manage-tools.ts` | Local state only; protected tools stay enabled |
| Change argument elicitation | `tool-registry-elicitation.ts` | Only missing required primitive fields are elicited |
| Handle inbound `notifications/cancelled` (implemented) | `server-factory.ts` | Registers `CancelledNotificationSchema` and forwards to `AutomationBridge.cancelMcpRequest`, which drops the matching queued work and, for in-flight work, sends a best-effort `cancel_request` frame to Unreal and suppresses the late response; it cannot interrupt an already-dispatched editor operation (advisory only) |
| Change MCP resources | `resource-registry.ts` | Resource handlers stay separate from tool calls |

## REQUEST FLOW
1. `tools/list`: detect client -> select effective categories -> query `dynamicToolManager` -> sanitize schemas. The public listing is permanently the single `unreal` tool; there is no legacy 23-tool listing.
2. `manage_tools`: the `configure` operation routes through `handleUnrealGatewayCall` and never reaches the local list-changed notifier, so no `notifications/tools/list_changed` is emitted on the (permanent) gateway surface.
3. Other calls: merge action params -> check enabled/connection -> elicit -> consolidated handler -> clean -> validate.
4. `system_control:get_project_settings` may fall back to project INI data without a live bridge.
5. Cancellation forwarding is **implemented** on this surface. `server-factory.ts` registers `CancelledNotificationSchema` and forwards it to `AutomationBridge.cancelMcpRequest`, which drops the matching queued work and sends a best-effort `cancel_request` frame to Unreal for in-flight work; it cannot interrupt an already-executing editor operation (advisory only). SDK AbortSignal cancellation converges on the same primitive.

## CONVENTIONS
- Keep `tool-registry.ts` as orchestration; put isolated listing, capability, control, or elicitation logic in its matching helper.
- The public surface is permanently the single `unreal` gateway tool; the `MCP_GATEWAY_MODE` flag and the `isGatewayMode()` gate were removed, so there is no mode branch to select.
- The gateway surface exposes a single stable `unreal` tool and never emits list-changed notifications, so client `listChanged` support does not affect the public listing.
- Keep `cleanObject()` before `responseValidator.wrapResponse()` and derive health success from the wrapped result.
- Preserve tool/action context, `isError`, health timing, and image-payload redaction on every response path.
- Register output schemas during server construction before serving calls.
- Stdio stdout is JSON-RPC-owned; lifecycle/logging changes must not emit ordinary runtime text there.
- Inbound `notifications/cancelled` forwards to the automation bridge's cancel primitive (`AutomationBridge.cancelMcpRequest`); the delivery and AbortSignal paths converge on the same idempotent primitive, and the matching late response is harmless because the tracker entry is removed on cancel.

## VALIDATION
```bash
npm run type-check
npx vitest run tests/unit/server_shutdown_contracts.test.ts src/handlers/resource-handlers.test.ts
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- Recombining split helper logic into `tool-registry.ts`.
- Dispatching `manage_tools` to Unreal or bypassing `dynamicToolManager`.
- Returning raw catalog definitions instead of sanitized enabled definitions.
- Mixing resource registration into the tool call path.
- Silently dropping inbound `notifications/cancelled` once forwarding is wired (forward to the automation bridge).
