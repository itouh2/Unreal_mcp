// src/server/mcp-primitives/progress/progress-sink-registry.ts
// Task 44: routes upstream progress to the ONE in-flight request that asked.
//
// Progress observations come back from Unreal keyed by the canonical MCP
// request id (`num:1` / `str:1`, already collision-free across the string and
// number id spaces). This table maps that id to the reporter holding THAT
// client's token, which is what keeps one request's progress — and one
// request's token — from ever reaching another concurrent request.
//
// Bounded by construction: `register` evicts oldest-first at the cap, so a
// client that opens requests faster than they settle cannot grow the table
// without limit. Lookups for an unknown id are a silent no-op, so a frame that
// arrives after its request settled is dropped rather than throwing inside the
// transport or resurrecting a closed reporter.
