/**
 * build_environment catalog: 150 authored CapabilityRecordSource entries
 * aggregated from family-sharded data files, folded by BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_FOLDS
 * into the 40 shipped records.
 *
 * Each authored entry is a CapabilityRecordSource (hashes are computed at parse
 * time by createCapabilityRecord / parseCapabilityCatalog). The authored set
 * equals the 150-action source set from the normalization inventory; the folded
 * count is pinned by tests/unit/build-environment-pilot-records.test.ts.

 * Family shards:
 *   landscape      16   foliage       14   procedural      5
 *   lighting       15   render-raytrace 18  render-postprocess 22
