 * World capability aggregate (frozen, fail-closed, deterministic).

 * Combines the 150 reused build_environment pilot records (referenced, never
 * regenerated) with the 151 net-new world records authored for Task 16
 * (manage_level_structure 45, manage_geometry 86, manage_pcg 30) into a
 * single 301-record frozen catalog. The aggregate is sorted by canonical ID
 * and frozen with Object.freeze so accidental mutation fails closed.
 *
 * Ownership: this file and the four record directories it imports are the only
 * Task 16 surface. It reuses build_environment data by import only.
