/**
 * Take Recorder records: create_take_recorder_panel, configure_take_sources,
 * start_recording, stop_recording, configure_recorded_tracks.
 *
 * Gated by MCP_SEQUENCE_HAS_TAKE_RECORDER_API (Takes plugin).
 *
 * ASYNC/ARTIFACT CONTRACT:
 * - start_recording begins recording into a ULevelSequence via
 *   UTakeRecorderBlueprintLibrary::StartRecording. It does NOT return a
 *   completed recording; the recording runs until stop_recording is called.
 * - stop_recording stops the recording and returns hasRecordedData.
 *   If no data was captured, returns RECORDING_OUTPUT_EMPTY.
 * - Take Recorder has NO interrupt/cancel. An in-progress recording must be
 *   stopped via stop_recording; there is no abort other than stop.
 * - Concurrent guard: starting while already recording returns
 *   ALREADY_RECORDING.
 * - Artifacts: a ULevelSequence asset containing recorded animation data.
