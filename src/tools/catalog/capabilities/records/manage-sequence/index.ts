/**
 * manage_sequence capability record catalog.
 *
 * 81 authored CapabilityRecordSource entries covering the 81 manage_sequence
 * actions in manage-sequence-tool.ts, folded by MANAGE_SEQUENCE_FOLDS into the
 * 19 shipped records carrying 89 callable legacy pairs. Each record is grounded
 * in the TypeScript handler bodies, native C++ Sequence domain dispatch,
 * and the audio/sequence/system closeout evidence.
 *
 * Families (6 + timeline base):
 * - timeline (31): lifecycle, playback, bindings, tracks, track-state, ranges
 * - metadata (2): get_metadata, set_metadata (cross-parent to Level domain)
 * - cinematic (18): CINEMATICS_ACTIONS
 * - mrq (8): MOVIE_RENDER_ACTIONS (async/cancellation/artifact contracts)
 * - media (8): MEDIA_ACTIONS (ElectraPlayer gate)
 * - take (5): Take Recorder (async, no cancel, artifact = LevelSequence)
 * - replay (9): Demo/killcam (async, no cancel, artifact = replay files)
