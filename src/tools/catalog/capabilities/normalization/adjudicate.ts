/**
 * Adjudication tables for the A-F normalization taxonomy.
 *
 * These tables are the explicit, reviewed disposition data required by the
 * plan. They are DATA, not computed guesses: every entry carries a human
 * justification and is the single source of truth for how a duplicated or
 * special action is normalized. The generator never merges solely on
 * action-name equality; the merged/shared set below is the only place two
 * tools are allowed to collapse to one canonical id, and it is restricted to
 * capabilities that are genuinely identical across surfaces (editor/system
 * console + viewport controls). The four `delete` targets are deliberately
 * NOT in this set, so they remain distinct canonical capabilities.
 *
 * The prior 'P' (primary baseline) class has been removed. Primary/alias
 * position is now carried by the separate `role` field on each occurrence, so
 * the `classification` field stays strictly A-F for all 1,335 occurrences.
