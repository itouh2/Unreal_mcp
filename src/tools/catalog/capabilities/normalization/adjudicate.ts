/**
 * Adjudication tables for the A-F normalization taxonomy.
 *
 * These tables are the explicit, reviewed disposition data required by the
 * plan. They are DATA, not computed guesses: every entry carries a human
 * justification and is the single source of truth for how a duplicated or
 * special action is normalized. The generator never merges solely on
 * action-name equality; the merged/shared set below is the only place two
 * tools are allowed to collapse to one canonical id, and it is restricted to
 * capabilities that are genuinely identical across surfaces (editor/system
 * console + viewport controls). The four `delete` targets are deliberately
 * NOT in this set, so they remain distinct canonical capabilities.
 *
 * The prior 'P' (primary baseline) class has been removed. Primary/alias
 * position is now carried by the separate `role` field on each occurrence, so
 * the `classification` field stays strictly A-F for all 1,341 occurrences.

/**
 * Reviewed fixed metrics that must be reproduced exactly from source.
 *
 * Re-reviewed once, for `manage_level.set_world_settings`: the native Level
 * dispatch already routed `set_level_world_settings`, but no record published
 * it, so a level's GameMode override was unreachable through the gateway and
 * callers had to fall back to system_control.execute_python. Publishing it adds
 * exactly one occurrence (1335 -> 1336) and one `set`-family verb (817 -> 818).
 * It introduces no duplicate name — `set_world_settings` is unique across the
 * surface — so the three duplicate/reduction metrics are unchanged.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a second time for `material.set_node_position`: material nodes
 * could be created at a coordinate but never moved, so a badly laid-out graph
 * could only be fixed by removing and re-adding the node, which drops its
 * connections. Publishing the move adds exactly one occurrence (1336 -> 1337)
 * and one `set`-family verb (818 -> 820); `set_node_position` is unique across
 * the surface, so the duplicate/reduction metrics are again unchanged.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a third time for content ingestion — `asset.list_content_sources`,
 * `asset.migrate_assets`, `system_control.list_plugins`,
 * `system_control.enable_plugin`, `system_control.disable_plugin`. These are
 * authored after the gateway migration and marked `post-migration`, so
 * `extractOccurrences()` skips them and they do not move the audited total.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a fourth time for `asset.list_fab_downloads`. Also post-migration,
 * so the audited total is unaffected.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a fifth time for the revision-control setup path —
 * `asset.source_control_enable`, `asset.source_control_init`,
 * `asset.source_control_commit_all`. Post-migration as well, so the audited
 * total holds at 1341.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a sixth time for MetaHuman Creator — `manage_character.metahuman_status`,
 * `create_metahuman`, `rig_metahuman`, `build_metahuman`, `export_metahuman`. Also
 * post-migration, so the audited total again holds at 1341.
 *
 * Re-reviewed a seventh time for `animation_physics.skin_mesh_to_skeleton`:
 * clothing could be imported but never worn. A garment arrives as a static
 * mesh, and parenting one to a character leaves it rigid while the body
 * animates underneath, so sleeves intersect arms and the hem stays put.
 * Skinning it to the same skeleton is the only thing that makes it move with
 * the body. Post-migration as well, so the audited total still holds at 1341.
 *
 * Re-reviewed an eighth time for `animation_physics.delete_transition`: a state
 * machine could gain transitions but never lose one, so a transition authored
 * between the wrong two states was permanent. The only workaround was to leave
 * it wired with a condition that can never be true, which is dead clutter that
 * still costs an evaluation. Post-migration as well, so the audited total holds
 * at 1341.
