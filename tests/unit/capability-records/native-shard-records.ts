/**
 * tests/unit/capability-records/native-shard-records.ts
 *
 * Task 29 support: decode the COMPLETE canonical records that the generated
 * native capability shards carry, as structured data.
 *
 * The shards are emitted by scripts/canonical-registry/native-shards.ts as
 * bounded, backslash-escaped, pure-ASCII C++ string literals:
 *
 *   TEXT("<chunk0>"),
 *   TEXT("<chunk1>"),
 *
 * Reconstruction is the exact inverse of `escapeCppLiteral` (only `\` and `"`
 * are escaped) followed by ordered concatenation. Non-ASCII was already turned
 * into JSON `\uXXXX` escapes BEFORE the C++ escaping, so undoing the C++ layer
 * leaves valid JSON that `JSON.parse` restores to the identical value.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a regex over C++ semantics: it decodes the payload
 * and parses it, so every downstream comparison is structured-data equality
 * rather than source-text matching.
