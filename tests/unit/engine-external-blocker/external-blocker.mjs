// Task 61 — the BLOCKED_EXTERNAL record for a UE minor that is not on this host.
//
// This project advertises UE 5.0-5.8. Four of those minors — 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6 —
// are not installed here, so four rows of that claim cannot be certified. The
// honest output is a blocker, not a quietly narrowed range, and not a skip.
//
// THE FAILURE MODE THIS FILE IS SHAPED AGAINST. Task 54 wired `npm audit` into CI
// at position 15 and never executed it, so a gate that would have failed was
// indistinguishable from one that passed. A blocker record is the same hazard in
// data form: the moment it carries a `pass`, an `ok` or a `verdict`, some later
// aggregator sums the wrong column and the missing minors evaporate into a green
// support matrix. So "no pass fields" is enforced mechanically, by a validator
// that REFUSES such a record, rather than by everyone remembering.
//
// WHY THE VALIDATOR IS A SEPARATE MODULE. This file builds records;
// external-blocker-validator.mjs refuses them. Neither imports the other. A
// builder that also approved its own output could only ever confirm its own
// assumptions — the same "compared the parser to itself" mistake Task 50 was
// written to stop.
//
// WHAT MAKES A RECORD FALSIFIABLE. Every one carries the command that detected the
// absence, the moment it ran, the digest of the detector's own source, and the
// digest of every `Engine/Build/Build.version` that WAS on the host at that
// moment. Install 5.1 and the host digest changes; edit the detector and the
// detector digest changes. Neither hash can be invented, because the validator
// recomputes both from the filesystem.
//
// VERSIONS COME FROM `Engine/Build/Build.version`, NEVER FROM A DIRECTORY NAME.
// `/data/UnrealEngine` carries no version in its name and contains 5.7.4, and
// `/data/UnrealEngine-5.8.0-preview-1` is tagged `5.8.0-release`. A record that
// trusted a folder name would file evidence under a minor nobody ran.
