// Task 50 — turning independent observations into a VERDICT about a claim.
//
// The observations in state-oracles.mjs are just readings. This file is where a
// reading is allowed to contradict a response, and it is written around one
// question: IF THE RESPONSE IS LYING, DOES ANYTHING HERE NOTICE?
//
// The claim under judgement is whatever the transport SAID happened. It is input,
// never evidence. A `{ success: true }` that changed nothing must come out of
// `judgeClaim` as FORGED_SUCCESS — a suite that cannot catch a lie is decoration.
//
// FIVE RULES, each paid for by a real failure in this plan:
//
//  1. NO PROOF WITHOUT PRE-STATE. Task 49 run 1: one transport read the other's
//     leftover asset and scored its own failed create as proven. `present` after
//     is meaningless unless `absent` before.
//  2. AN INCONCLUSIVE READING NEVER PASSES. An oracle that could not look is not
//     an oracle that saw nothing.
//  3. THE SETUP MUST BE ASSERTED. Task 46's drain test proved a container emptied
//     that had never been filled. A proof over an empty container is vacuous.
//  4. EVERY POLARITY NEEDS A POSITIVE CONTROL. Without one, an oracle that reports
//     "absent" for everything satisfies every absence assertion in the suite, and
//     the suite is green while detecting nothing.
//  5. A MUTATION CLAIM NEEDS AT LEAST ONE OUT-OF-BAND READING. Corroboration from
//     a second transport is welcome; it is not a substitute, because it shares the
//     plugin and the queue with the mutation it is corroborating.
