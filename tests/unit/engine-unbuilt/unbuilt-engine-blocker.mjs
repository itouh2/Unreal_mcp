// Tasks 57 and 58 — an engine that is INSTALLED, correctly identified, and whose
// editor target was never finished building.
//
// One module, two records: /data/UnrealEngine-5.3.2 and /data/UnrealEngine-5.5.4
// are the same finding against two roots, and each task still emits its own
// evidence file. Nothing here is shared with either subject's engine — the roots
// are read independently and never stand in for one another.
//
// THREE BLOCKER CLASSES NOW EXIST IN THIS PLAN, AND TASK 62 SUMS THEM. Merging
// any two of them destroys the only information the operator needs:
//
//   ABSENT               Task 61. The minor is not on this host at all
//                        (MINOR_NOT_INSTALLED). Remediation: obtain and install
//                        the engine. Nothing on disk to work with.
//   PRESENT_BUT_UNBUILT  THIS FILE. The tree is on disk, states its own version
//                        in Engine/Build/Build.version, and has no
//                        Engine/Binaries/Linux/UnrealEditor-Cmd
//                        (NO_COMPILED_EDITOR). Remediation: compile the engine's
//                        editor target — hours of machine time and tens of GB,
//                        i.e. a host-capacity decision, never a code change.
//   PRESENT_UNBUILDABLE  Task 56's UE 5.0 shape, which additionally could not
//                        compile the engine's own C# build tools on this host.
//
// The three differ in what an operator must DO, so this module refuses to emit a
// remediation it did not measure: the .NET step Task 56's record requires is
// derived from THAT root's toolchain, and a root whose UnrealBuildTool and
// AutomationTool are already compiled must not inherit it.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE NEVER DOES: install, download, compile or launch anything. It
// reads the filesystem and reports. The remediation it describes is an operator
// action, exactly as in Tasks 56 and 61.
