/**
 * Contract for authoring a capability AFTER the legacy migration.
 *
 * The normalization inventory audits the pre-gateway 23-tool surface: every
 * `{tool, action}` pair that actually shipped. `extractOccurrences()` derives
 * that audit from each record's `legacyIds`, and `REVIEWED_METRICS` pins the
 * result at 1,340. Those two numbers coincide with the record count only
 * because every migrated record carries exactly one legacy pair — an artifact
 * of the 1:1 migration, not an invariant.
 *
 * A capability authored after the migration has a live `{tool, action}` pair
 * but no historical one, so `legacyIds` would otherwise have to lie in one of
 * two directions: declare the pair and inflate an audit of what shipped, or
 * omit it and lose the action enum that `deriveParents()` builds from exactly
 * that field. `normalization.provenance` resolves the ambiguity as data.
 *
 * These tests pin every edge of that contract: both fail-closed directions (an
 * unmarked addition still trips the gate, a marked-in-error migrated record
 * trips it too), that routing survives the skip, and that being skipped by the
 * audit buys no licence to claim a pair another capability already owns.
