/**
 * Routing contract for the promoted WidgetAuthoring routes.
 *
 * Eighteen WidgetAuthoring operations are implemented natively but were never
 * registered on a canonical parent, so the route ledger classes them
 * `promote`. Reaching them through `manage_blueprint` needs BOTH routing
 * surfaces to name the action, and neither is generated:
 *
 * - TypeScript: `WIDGET_AUTHORING_ACTIONS` feeds `widgetAuthoringActionSet`,
 *   which decides whether the consolidated handler dispatches to the widget
 *   domain or falls through to the Blueprint handler.
 * - Native: the `WidgetAuthoring()` array backs `IsWidgetAuthoringAction`,
 *   which is the gate the `manage_blueprint` registration lambda consults
 *   before forwarding to `HandleManageWidgetAuthoringAction`.
 *
 * The native half is asserted as source text on purpose: this suite has no
 * compiler, so the array contents are the only checkable proof that the
 * plugin would forward the action rather than silently mis-route it.
