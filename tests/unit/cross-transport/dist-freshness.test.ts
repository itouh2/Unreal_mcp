// Task 46 remediation - the staleness hole in the live matrix gate.
//
// The probe drives `node dist/cli.js` for the stdio transport. Nothing made
// dist/ current, so run 1 reported two HIGH findings - STALE_STATE downgraded
// (F3) and options.preview silently ignored (F6) - that were true of a dist/
// built three hours BEFORE those fixes landed and false of the working tree.
// A gate that emits false HIGH findings is worse than no gate: it burns
// reviewer trust and sends people to fix bugs that do not exist.
//
// Two halves are pinned here, because either alone leaves the hole open:
//   1. the freshness check itself must actually distinguish stale / missing /
//      current, and must not cry stale over a file the build never reads;
//   2. the probe must REFUSE - loudly, before it opens either transport and
//      before it writes any report - when the dist/ it is about to spawn does
//      not match the working tree.
//
// Case 6 is the regression test proper: it runs the REAL probe against a
// deliberately staled tree and fails if the probe gets as far as producing a
// result. It asserts the refusal by its message, not merely by a non-zero exit,
// because before the fix the probe also exited non-zero in that tree - for the
// unrelated reason that the registry was missing. A test that accepted any
// failure would have passed against the defect.
