// Task 51 — the console-command instantiation of the differential, and the five
// asymmetry classes the two surfaces are DESIGNED to have.
//
// TypeScript and the plugin do not share one matcher; they share one generated rule
// SET, from which each surface takes the rules addressed to it. That is deliberate
// (`appliesTo: 'typescript' | 'native' | 'both'` in console-command-policy-rules.ts),
// so a naive "both surfaces must agree on every string" differential would report
// dozens of by-design differences and teach everyone to ignore it.
//
// The classes below are derived by READING THE RULES, before running anything. Each
// names the rule ids that produce it and argues why that direction is safe. Two
// facts drive every argument:
//
//   * THE UE CONSOLE EXECUTES THE FIRST TOKEN. Later tokens are arguments to that
//     command; there is no shell, so `stat fps rm` does not delete anything. The
//     native gate is therefore precise where TypeScript is conservative.
//   * THE PLUGIN IS THE SOLE AUTHORIZATION AUTHORITY and re-enforces every request
//     before it reaches the editor queue. TypeScript being stricter is redundancy.
//     TypeScript being laxer costs a wasted round trip, not a bypass — but it is
//     still recorded, marked defenceInDepthOnly, and must be argued, because a
//     native-transport client never traverses TypeScript at all.
//
// What is NOT here, deliberately: any entry keyed on a seed, an input, or a count.
//
// This module is kept FREE of `src/` imports so it can be loaded by plain node as
// well as by vitest. The src-bound bindings (the rule inventory and the default
// TypeScript side) live in command-parity-source.mjs; the offline CLI supplies the
// same functions from `dist/`. Both paths reach the one generated evaluator — the
// split is about module resolution, never about having a second implementation.
