// Task 51 — the 500-cycle cleanup soak.
//
// A soak is not "the load test, for longer". It answers one question: after N
// complete create/use/destroy cycles, is the process holding anything it did not
// hold after the first one? So the shape is deliberate:
//
//   * ONE long-lived child, many cycles. Restarting the process between cycles
//     would reset exactly the accumulation the soak exists to find.
//   * A CYCLE IS A FULL LIFECYCLE, not a repeated read. Each cycle creates
//     session-scoped state (enable a capability), uses it, then destroys it
//     (disable it) — because state that is never destroyed cannot be leaked by a
//     faulty teardown, and a soak over pure reads would be green against a broken
//     one. THE CYCLE MUST PROVE IT OPENED SOMETHING: the first version called
//     `enable_tool`, which manage_tools answers with UNKNOWN_ACTION, and checked
//     only for a timeout — so it cycled nothing 500 times and reported no
//     failures.
//   * COMPLETED CYCLES ARE COUNTED, NOT PLANNED ONES. Returning `spec.cycles`
//     reports the argument the caller passed in.
//   * THE BASELINE IS TAKEN AFTER WARM-UP, and again at a fixed midpoint. Two
//     samples separate "V8 grew its heap once" from "every cycle costs bytes":
//     a leak shows up as a rising second half, a one-off shows up as a flat one.
//
// The process-residue half is separate and blunt: spawn real children, close them,
// and confirm through /proc that each one is actually gone. `close()` returning is
// the claim; an absent /proc entry is the proof.

 *   * A CYCLE COUNTS ONLY IF IT OPENED. The old cycle called `enable_tool` /
 *     `disable_tool` — actions manage_tools does not have (they are `enable_tools`
 *     / `disable_tools`, taking `tools: []` under `params`) — so every cycle in the
 *     recorded 500-cycle run answered UNKNOWN_ACTION twice and cycled nothing. The
 *     cycle still returned ok because only a timeout was checked. A "cleanup soak"
 *     that never creates state cannot observe a faulty teardown.
 *
 *   * CLOSE EXACTLY WHAT WAS OPENED. If the middle step fails after `enable`
 *     succeeded, the capability is STILL enabled; returning early there would leave
 *     it enabled for every remaining cycle, making the harness itself the leak it
 *     exists to detect. Conversely, when `enable` did not open anything, `disable`
 *     is NOT sent — issuing it would fabricate a teardown for state that never
 *     existed and paint an UNKNOWN_ACTION run green.
