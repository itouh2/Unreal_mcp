// Task 51 — the adversarial RUNTIME properties: path/symlink containment, the
// idempotency ledger under interleaving, and settle-once cancellation.
//
// These are deliberately NOT source-contract checks. The plugin's constant-time
// token compare and its fail-closed non-loopback bind are already pinned by
// tests/unit/plugin/security_contracts.test.ts, which reads the C++ and asserts the
// required and forbidden patterns; re-asserting the same strings here would add a
// second place to update and no new detection. This file drives the REAL objects
// with seeded hostile input instead, which is the coverage the static checks cannot
// give: a rule can be present in the source and still be walked past at run time.
//
// This module holds no `src/` imports so plain node can load it; the bindings to
// the real sanitizePath and IdempotencyLedger live in security-properties-source.mjs,
// and an offline CLI supplies the same two from `dist/`. The split is about module
// resolution only — both paths drive the one production implementation.
//
// THE SYMLINK CHECK USES A REAL SYMLINK. A containment test that only concatenates
// strings proves the string logic and nothing about the filesystem: the escape that
// matters is a path that is textually inside the owned root and resolves outside it.
// So the fixtures are created on disk, under a directory this suite owns, and the
// predicate is asked about the RESOLVED path.
