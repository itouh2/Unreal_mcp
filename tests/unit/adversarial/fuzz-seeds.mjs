// Task 51 — the FIXED seeds and time budgets. This file is the reason a finding in
// this suite can be handed to someone else.
//
// SEEDS ARE PINNED, NOT ROLLED. A suite that seeds from the clock finds more bugs
// per week and can prove none of them: the run that failed is gone, the artifact
// says "seed 1753649201337", and nobody can tell whether today's green means fixed
// or means a different corpus. Pinned seeds make every run comparable and make
// "this regressed" a statement about the code rather than about the dice.
//
// GROWING COVERAGE IS DONE BY ADDING A SEED, NOT BY RANDOMISING ONE. Append a new
// named entry; the existing entries keep reproducing the corpus already reasoned
// about. `MCP_FUZZ_EXTRA_SEED` exists for an operator who wants to explore beyond
// the pinned set — it is additive, never a replacement, and a finding it produces
// must be pinned here before it counts as covered.
//
// BUDGETS ARE CASE COUNTS, NOT WALL CLOCK. A time-bounded fuzz loop generates a
// different number of cases on a loaded machine, so a green run proves nothing about
// what was executed. Counts make the executed corpus identical everywhere; the time
// ceilings below exist only to fail a run that has hung, not to size it.
