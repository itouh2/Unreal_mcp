// tests/eval/known-breaches.ts
// The reviewed, documented breach ledger for Task 48.
//
// The ledger is currently EMPTY: every declared budget passes, so nothing is
// excused. It never weakens a threshold and never makes a failing gate pass.
// What it adds is the distinction between "a breach we investigated and cannot
// close honestly" and "a breach that just appeared", which a bare red suite
// cannot express.
//
// It is deliberately double-sided, so it cannot rot into an excuse:
//   - a breach NOT listed here fails the gate (regression detection intact);
//   - a listed breach that starts PASSING also fails the gate, forcing the
//     entry to be deleted rather than left behind as stale cover.
//
// Adding an entry here is a review decision, not a workaround. Each one must
// carry the remedies that were actually measured and why each was rejected.
